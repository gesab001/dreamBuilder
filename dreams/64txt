As I look out through its transparent wall, I see the beauty of many stars and colorful cloud-like formations. Coming from my left, I hear a galloping horse and the sound of a trumpet. Looking through the opening toward what I know is Orion, I see a white horse running very fast toward me. An angel is riding on the horse, and he is leaning over toward the right side next to the horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane. He is holding onto the horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane with his left hand, and in his right hand, he is holding a very long golden trumpet. As the horse runs toward me at an amazing speed through the corridor, the angel blows on the trumpet. I know that the trumpet\xe2\x80\x99s sound is announcing something that is about to happen. Its sound continues and gets louder.</p>\r\n    <p>Suddenly and very quickly, the horse stops in front of me. The angel immediately jumps off the left side of the horse, leans the trumpet against the horse, and comes around to its right side where I am standing. He tells me to prepare for the great messenger, because the one I call the Herald has been sent with messages that are to be shared, and I will be instructed when to share them. Again the angel says to prepare for the great messenger, because he brings a message from the heavenly Father, spoken while He sits on His throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<!-------------------------->\r\n<div class="excerpt_end">\r\n<!-- THIS CLASS IS NEEDED --> \r\n<!-------------------------->\r\n\r\n    <p>The angel places his right hand on my left shoulder, calls me by my heavenly name, and again instructs me to prepare for the great messenger. He turns and goes to my right side and points toward the sky. I see the Herald in a very large room at a very large table where I see maps, many sheets of paper, blueprints, and books. I watch as he rolls up the maps, then stacks the sheets of paper and puts them into a certain order. Then he proceeds to roll up the blueprints. As he begins to put the maps, blueprints, stacks of paper, and books in his arms, there are so many that he calls for others who stand nearby to help gather the rest of the maps, blueprints, papers, and books.</p>\r\n    <p>After all the items are gathered, the Herald stops to make sure that not one message he was given is left behind. I know that this great messenger is the one who took Satan\xe2\x80\x99s place, and now he stands nearest to the throne of God. This angel, who asked to be called the Herald and always tells me that the only name that is worthy to be spoken is Jesus, is the angel named Gabriel. Carrying all the items that were on the table, he and the other angels proceed through the door and leave the room.</p>\r\n    <p>Next, the announcing angel, the one who announced the Herald\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, informs me that he is to show me something. He touches my right hand, and immediately I am in the openness of space. I see a very dark background; it is the pit where the earth is. The angel tells me to watch closely, because I will be shown things that are symbolic but literally happen. I now watch six, clearly illuminated angels carrying into view a very large, pure golden trumpet. There are three angels on each side of the trumpet, which is as large as several train cars. Once the trumpet is in place, the same six angels place a second trumpet inside the first trumpet. Once that trumpet is in place, the same six angels place a third trumpet inside the second trumpet. The angels repeat the process with three more trumpets. Six trumpets have now been stacked. I understand that this is a symbol of what has already been fulfilled.</p>\r\n    <p>Now the announcing angel states that he is to show me the next message. Again, I am looking up toward Orion. I see the same six angels moving a seventh trumpet into place. Each trumpet has always been aligned with the mouthpiece facing Orion and the bell end toward the earth. The angel tells me to watch closely. Now I see the Herald coming through Orion with his assisting angels a little behind him, and they enter into the mouthpiece end of the trumpet. The angel tells me to watch the bell end of the trumpet. Suddenly, I hear the most tremendous brass sounds coming from the trumpet, as if a thousand train horns were blowing at the same time. It almost seems as if the Herald and the angels are causing the sound, because they are moving through the trumpet so quickly. Suddenly, I see the Herald come through the bell end of the trumpet. He is carrying the maps, blueprints, papers, and books. The other angels carrying the rest of the items follow behind. I am made to understand that the seventh trumpet is not yet ready to be placed with the others, because it has not been completely fulfilled.</p>\r\n    <p>The dream changes and now I stand looking out over a large, very green pasture with tall grass and countless lambs. Some run and play, others eat, and some are curled up asleep. A small flowing stream meanders through the pasture. In the distance, I notice a man walking along the stream. He is dressed in a long white robe; his hair is wavy and lies on his shoulders. He holds a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s rod in his right hand and a straight staff in his left hand. I hear him speak gently to the lambs. From a distance, I see him turn and begin to walk toward me. As he approaches, I recognize that He is Jesus. I want to run to Him, but the angel says to wait. When Jesus reaches me, I hug Him and say how much I have missed my walk with Him and ask why it has been so long. He smiles and replies that He is with me every day.</p>\r\n    <p>Jesus reveals that the messages in this dream began months ago, in February of 2012. However, there was a reason why I was not to share each message separately, but rather as one, long dream. Then Jesus tells me that certain events we see happening will occur more frequently. He stresses that very many are losing their way as Satan throws obstacles in their path, such as wrong teachings on the seven trumpets. Many spend their time pursuing new ideas that are contrary to what has already been revealed. He reminds me that we have been instructed to prepare for the great battle that lies just ahead. Satan and his army are doing all they can to cause God\xe2\x80\x99s people to lose their way on the path to heaven.</p>\r\n    <p>Jesus takes my right hand, and we begin walking through the pasture. He tells me to notice that His sheep obey out of love, not fear. He also tells me to notice that the sheep are all lambs. Then He shares the following illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cAs it is written, I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d [Matthew 18:3] Children are teachable and more apt to listen and obey; whereas adults are more set in their ways and not as willing to accept the messages of truth that are presented. Jesus restates that unless we become as little children, we will never enter the kingdom of heaven.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-1" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-1\')" >1</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-1" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Signs of the Times, January 2, 1893</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tEveryone who will humble himself as a little child, who will receive and obey the Word of God with a child\'s simplicity will be among the elect of God.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-1").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-1", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>Suddenly, I hear a song called, \xe2\x80\x9cHis Sheep Am I\xe2\x80\x9d being sung. It is not angels singing or a choir. I turn around and see a multitude of children singing. They are divided into two groups. One group stands on the right and the other on the left. Each child wears a white robe. The bottom of each robe has a border that resembles a very bright light. I understand these are innocent, sinless children, before the age of accountability. As they sing the refrain, the left and right group alternate. These are the words I hear:</p>\r\n     \r\n            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>His Sheep Am I</strong></p>\r\n            <p style="text-align: center;">In God\'s green pastures feeding by His cool waters lie;<br />\r\n             Soft in the evening walk my Lord and I,<br />\r\n             All the sheep of His pasture<br />\r\n             Fare so wondrously fine; His sheep am I.</p>\r\n            <p style="text-align: center;">Refrain:<br />\r\n             Left group: Waters cool,<br />\r\n             Right group: In the valley;<br />\r\n             Left group: Pastures green,<br />\r\n             Right group: On the mountain,<br />\r\n             Both groups: In the evening walk my Lord and I.</p>\r\n            <p style="text-align: center;">Left group: Dark the night,<br />\r\n             Right group: In the valley,<br />\r\n             Left group: Rough the way,<br />\r\n             Right group: On the mountain,<br />\r\n            Both groups: Step by step my Lord and I.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-note-a" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-note-a\')" >a</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-note-a" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-body"><em>His Sheep Am I</em>, lyrics by Orien Johnson</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-note-a").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-note-a", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>As the song ends, Jesus shares that He gave all for His children. He has sent messages to His people. Those who are willing to listen to His voice will be provided fresh cool water and green pastures. They will receive His guidance, protection, and comfort. Those who walk contrary to the messages will suffer the wrath of God.</p>\r\n    <p>The first issue I am allowed to share now was revealed to me for the first time in February 2012. The Herald shows me Eve in the Garden of Eden. She has just transgressed the command given to not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Herald explains that because of her sin, it was commanded that she was to follow the spiritual guidance of her husband. This was to apply to all wives from that point on, as long as the husband\xe2\x80\x99s guidance agreed with God\xe2\x80\x99s will. \xe2\x80\x9cWives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit [proper] in the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d [Colossians 3:18.] The Herald further explains that they are still to be equal as man and wife, and that the wife is not to be under the husband, as in a dictatorship. Please note that when \xe2\x80\x9chusbands require the complete submission of their wives, declaring that women have no voice or will in the family, but must render entire submission, they place their wives in a position contrary to the Scripture.\xe2\x80\x9d [<em>The Adventist Home</em>, p. 116] \xe2\x80\x9cHusbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church\xe2\x80\xa6and the wife see that she reverence [respects] her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d [Ephesians 5:25, 33.]\r\n    <p>The Herald continues by stating that soon we will see Seventh-day Adventist conferences no longer following God\xe2\x80\x99s directive that only men lead out as ordained pastors. I am told that God\xe2\x80\x99s church will transgress His commands by ordaining women to serve as pastors.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-2" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-2\')" >2</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-2" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 3, p. 295</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tGod distinguished Aaron by choosing him and his male posterity for the priesthood.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-2").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-2", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Along with this, we will witness the acceptance of homosexuality within the Seventh-day Adventist organization.\r\n\r\n<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-3" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-3\')" >3</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-3" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Leviticus 18:22</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tThou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Leviticus 20:13</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tIf a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Mark 10:6-8</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tBut from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

Behind it is the corridor that opens out into God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom. The Holy City sits perfectly visible in the distance. As I look at its extreme beauty, even from a great distance, I hear the voice of God as I have heard it before. It is like a thunderous waterfall, a stream, and a trickle of water, all at the same time. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have watched as My Church has degraded from My blueprint. I have watched as the services to worship Me have become irreverent, and every possible form of evil has been brought into My earthly court. Many no longer worship Me, but instead worship him who rules the earth. This earth-ruler commands those whom he has deceived to worship in an unholy manner. I have witnessed as My commands have been transgressed. To those who serve as leaders in My Church, I have spoken a promise of what I will do if transgression continues.

Now we are just a few hundred feet in the air above what I know to be the old Battle Creek Sanitarium. I watch as many angels descend from on high.

Then everything I see slows down and we descend once again. Again, the Herald and I are only a few hundred feet in the air above Battle Creek, Michigan. Angels approach the Review and Herald publishing house and pour out the same liquid over it.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald tells me that he is to show me another example. He takes my right hand, and I find myself now standing along a rocky mountain path. I see a man and three women ascending the path that leads away from a city below. They are dressed in clothing from the Old Testament times. The Herald explains that I am observing Lot, his wife, and their two daughters leaving Sodom, as the angels instructed them to do.</p>\r\n    <p>Now the Herald draws my attention to what looks like swarms of bees, but I know they are angels rapidly descending upon the city of Sodom. The Herald requests one of the angels to come and show me his container, which is like what the other angels are carrying. As I look inside, I see what resembles the same liquid used by the angels for the Battle Creek fires. I notice it has a strange odor, like sulfur.\r\n\t\t<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-9" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-9\')" >9</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-9" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Luke 17:29</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tBut the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</span></span>\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-container"><a target="_blank" href="http://chemistry.wikia.com/wiki/Sulfur"><span class="fn-ref">http://chemistry.wikia.com/wiki/Sulfur</span></a><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAlthough sulfur is blamed for the smell\xe2\x80\x94, e.g. of rotten eggs\xe2\x80\x94 elemental sulfur has only the faintest odor (the odor associated with rotten eggs is actually due to hydrogen sulfide and organic sulfur compounds).</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-9").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-9", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> The Herald tells the angel to go and do what God has commanded him to do. The angel quickly ascends and joins the army of angels sent from heaven. Quickly, many situate themselves a little distance above Sodom and begin to pour the liquid upon the city below. As people try to flee from Sodom, many angels quickly knock them to the ground, and pour the liquid over them. God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is being meted out.</p>\r\n    <p>As I stand observing what I am to report as a messenger, the Herald reminds me that Lot and his family were told not to turn around to look at the city behind them. However, now I see that Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife stops walking, as if deciding to see what is happening behind her. She turns around completely and faces Sodom. She watches as the angels descend from on high with the vials of God\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. In an instant, her feet turn into a white, crystalline substance. This change continues upward; her eyes are the last to crystallize. They reveal her attachment to her beloved city, which is now being destroyed. Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife has turned into a pillar of salt. I watch as the wind blows, and very slowly erodes her form.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald and I turn, ascend toward Orion, and again pass through the corridor that opens out into God\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom and the Holy City. Once again I hear God\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and as He speaks, I see these words clearly in view.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\xe2\x80\x9cAs it is written in Ezekiel 9:4-11 \xe2\x94\x80 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not. And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head. And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.\xe2\x80\x9d<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-10" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-10\')" >10</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-10" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">1 Peter 4:17</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tFor the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, p. 211</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tThe class who do not feel grieved over their own spiritual declension, nor mourn over the sins of others, will be left without the seal of God.

Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house."<br /><br />\r\n\t\tHere we see that the church--the Lord\'s sanctuary--was the first to feel the stroke of the wrath of God. The ancient men, those to whom God had given great light and who had stood as guardians of the spiritual interests of the people, had betrayed their trust. They had taken the position that we need not look for miracles and the marked manifestation of God\'s power as in former days. Times have changed. These words strengthen their unbelief, and they say: The Lord will not do good, neither will He do evil. He is too merciful to visit His people in judgment. Thus "Peace and safety" is the cry from men who will never again lift up their voice like a trumpet to show God\'s people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins. These dumb dogs that would not bark are the ones who feel the just vengeance of an offended God.

All we have, all the bounties of His grace which we possess, we owe to God. The aggravating character of sin against such a God cannot be estimated any more than the heavens can be measured with a span. God is a moral governor as well as a Father. He is the Lawgiver. He makes and executes His laws.

I am made aware that this does not mean we would join together, but that our different paths would intersect. Only one path can be correct.</p>\r\n    <p>Some independent ministries that uphold the teachings and directions of the General Conference are also included in the destruction.</p>\r\n    <p>All these ministries and their employees are consumed in the cleansing fire of God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath. The General Conference building, certain publishing houses, union and conference offices, hospitals, and schools are gone. The angels have obeyed God\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, and now they return to heaven to report to Him that they have done as He commanded.</p>\r\n    <p>I am now taken up high where I see the earth spin quickly as before. The Herald and I descend and now observe a large Seventh-day Adventist church on Sabbath morning. It is one of many churches that have fallen deeply into apostasy. I am observing members arriving at the church to be entertained, not to hear a message spoken through the Holy Spirit. They are there to dance, sing, and visit. The members of this particular church do not hear the things that are spoken about in a repentant church.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald and I enter the church, where we see an abomination called a worship service being conducted. I understand that no one has any excuse for these unholy worship practices. They have all been given light on how to worship. The pastors have no excuse, because they have been given specific instructions from the pen of Ellen White. Even the dream called, \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/47-reverence-my-sanctuary/" target="_blank">Reverence My Sanctuary</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d gave instructions on how to worship.

As we walk, Jesus reveals that the faith He has asked of many, He sees in so few. He says that many are called, but few are chosen; many are called, but few choose. He shares how God has sent many messages through prophets. Yet they have been hated, some killed, lied about, and their messages quickly dismissed by most.</p>\r\n    <p>The dream changes, and we are now walking on one of the streets of gold in heaven.

He explains how Satan came in and tried to destroy the messages, and how I fell and asked for forgiveness. He explains that He lifted me back up and again placed His mantle on me.

Just such a work as that which John did, is to be carried on in these last days. The Lord is giving messages to His people, through the instruments He has chosen, and He would have all heed the admonitions and warnings He sends. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Our message is not to be one of peace and safety. As a people who believe in Christ\'s soon appearing, we have a definite message to bear,--"Prepare to meet thy God."<br /><br />\r\n\t\tOur message must be as direct as was that of John.

The judgment of God was not yet finished. A fire came from the cloud of glory and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. They were princes; that is, men generally of good judgment, and of influence in the congregation, men of renown. They were highly esteemed, and their judgment had often been sought in difficult matters. But they were affected by a wrong influence, and became envious, jealous and rebellious. They perished not with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, because they were not the first in rebellion. They were to see their end first, and have an opportunity of repenting of their crime.

But in rejecting God\'s chosen instrument they rejected Christ; they insulted the Spirit of God. So, in the days of Christ, the Jewish scribes and elders, who professed great zeal for the honor of God, crucified His Son.

They are pleased and proud of what they have done. I now observe the following. One of them walks along with a large bag of money under his arm. I see another with a large Bible that has a locking strap around it. The lock is old, and the key is lost. The Bible has not been opened for quite some time. Another walks with a large white horse. One gets out of an airplane. Another carries scrolls and books. Another carries a sign about how great he is. One waves a banner stating that Ernie Knoll is NOT A PROPHET.org. There is another person with clocks and sextants. One woman wears a dress with images of the moon. Another woman dresses like Ellen White in the 1800\xe2\x80\x99s. As these and others walk along, they talk about their mission to dismiss the messages, myself, and this ministry.</p>\r\n    <p>Suddenly, the ground opens just a little, and each one is standing in a hole up to their ankles. They are separate from each other. They try to free themselves but are not able to. As they stand there for a little while, the ground suddenly opens and closes. They are now in the ground a little below their knees. As others run to rescue them, they also become trapped in the ground. Many stand at a distance in horror, because the ground now holds all these people.</p>\r\n    <p>As time goes by, the ground is constantly shaking them back and forth. It looks as if the ground is hungry and literally devouring them. No one else nearby feels the earth moving, only those who are trapped. The bystanders are unable to help. Slowly, the ground continues to devour its victims, who now are held captive just a little above the knees. The more they try to free themselves, the harder the ground becomes around them. In some places it looks like they stand in the middle of a solid rock.</p>\r\n    <p>Many of those watching fall to their knees and beg for God\xe2\x80\x99s mercy on those who are trapped. Many cry out that it was through one of those individuals that they were brought to Christ. Others mention all the great things another individual has done. However, just because someone does great things for God, does not mean they will be saved automatically. Notice the following Bible verse: \xe2\x80\x9cFor it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.\xe2\x80\x9d 2 Peter 2:21.</p>\r\n    <p>I now look up and see angels writing cloud-like letters in the sky. The words tell how each was given ample opportunity to approach God\xe2\x80\x99s throne. Each one had been contacted personally by individuals who had written them, asking them to repent. Every once in a while the ground opens up then quickly closes, and all these individuals slide further down into the mouth of the earth.</p>\r\n    <p>As time progresses and the earth shakes, the individuals are covered to their waist. Then they are swallowed to their ribs. Moments later the ground opens and they are under the ground up to their necks. They each have time to contemplate the things they have said and done. Each knows that the final judgment is upon him or her. They had stood proudly to dismiss God\xe2\x80\x99s messages and lead people away from the truth. Now the ground opens for the last time, and each one drops slowly down, buried in the earth.</p>\r\n    <p>I turn to Jesus, and He reminds me that the instruction the angels received in Ezekiel 9 was to show no remorse. It is the same for these who were not they. They were begged to ask forgiveness of their sins. Because they did not, God\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was delivered to them. This is another example for those who teach the lie that God does not kill.</p>\r\n    <p>The scene changes, and once again, I am walking with Jesus on a large body of water that looks like an ocean of pure glass. I see these words in the sky:</p>\r\n    <p style="text-align: center;">\r\n         <strong>B</strong>lessed <strong>B</strong>e the <strong>O</strong>nes<br />\r\n        who <strong>B</strong>elieve <strong>B</strong>efore<br />\r\n        the <strong>E</strong>vidence <strong>M</strong>ounts\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Jesus again says how many wait for a sign before they will believe. For many it will be too late. Jesus becomes quiet. He looks down then back up, and this time there are tears in His eyes. He asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWill I find faith before the evidence mounts?\xe2\x80\x9d Of all the times I have been with Jesus, I had never seen Him cry. The horrible event of what I just saw has caused Him to cry, because He died on the cross for those individuals. I stand there now watching my Jesus, my Brother cry. I want to reach up and wipe the tears from His face, but I know I cannot. I know that no angel can wipe the tears from His face.</p>\r\n    <p>With tears still in His eyes, He points up to what is written in the sky and He writes it again. The only thing that changes is the lettering color. I now see the letters in pure, solid gold. Behind each of these letters is a larger, blue letter. Behind each of the gold and blue letters are larger, white letters. All these are written against a dark blue sky. Again, I see the words:</p>\r\n    <p style="text-align: center;">\r\n         <strong>B</strong>lessed <strong>B</strong>e the <strong>O</strong>nes<br />\r\n        who <strong>B</strong>elieve <strong>B</strong>efore<br />\r\n        the <strong>E</strong>vidence <strong>M</strong>ounts\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Again, I turn and notice that wherever I look in the clear water, the words are perfectly reflected as if in a mirror, yet the letters are not upside down. No matter where I look I see His message clearly and perfectly.</p>\r\n    <p>Again with tears, Jesus repeats that many will stand waiting for a sign before they believe, and before the evidence mounts. For many it will be too late when they see their proof. Jesus stands very quietly.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald, who has been standing behind me, takes my hand and we now see from up high what happens after God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is poured out on His Church. I see smoke rising from where there were once buildings. I know that the destruction was not from an atomic weapon, but rather a device of God. It was a consuming fire that burned from the inside and left nothing but ashes, which begin to blow in the wind. On the ground are bodies in the form of ashes. There is nothing left to bury.</p>\r\n    <p>Next, I am taken to where I view a very large television screen. There are news reports and talk shows about the devastation that occurred. It is reported that only Seventh-day Adventist institutions and those in them were destroyed. Everyone is calling it the wrath of God. Several stations broadcast how non-Adventist buildings next to those destroyed were unharmed. As I look down, I see a popular news magazine. The front cover shows a photo of the ashen remains of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference world headquarters. The caption reads, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s Wrath Upon an Evil Cult.\xe2\x80\x9d The smaller print mentions how God has poured out His wrath upon a cult that refuses to worship on God\xe2\x80\x99s holy day, Sunday. Looking around, I see national and international news stories that state the same thing.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald and I rise a little further in the air, and he explains that what I see now is a quick succession over several weeks. I see Adventist churches that were not harmed. Many of the members flee from the churches.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-37" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-37\')" >37</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-37" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Great Controversy (1888), p. 608</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAs the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith in the third angel\'s message, but have not been sanctified through obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join the ranks of the opposition.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-37").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-37", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Places are set up where those surviving members can request to have their membership transferred to the Sunday church of their choice. Talk shows interview certain members, who mention how they were deceived into believing the Adventist teachings. They state that now they understand that because of God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath they need to keep the Sabbath holy on the first day of the week. I am shocked as I see those who I recognize who once stood as speakers for the Adventist church and proclaimed the true, biblical, seventh-day Sabbath. They now spit upon the Seventh-day Adventist name. The Herald turns to me and says how that name was inspired through the Holy Spirit. That name is not just a name on a building. Buildings can be destroyed, but no one can destroy the name written on the hearts of God\xe2\x80\x99s true believers. Those individuals will also have God\xe2\x80\x99s name written on their foreheads.</p>\r\n    <p>Now I look down at Adventist churches around the world that speak different languages. Members flee from them, remove the Seventh-day Adventist name from their hearts, and write another name. I look to the Herald and ask if there is no one who will have the Seventh-day Adventist name on their hearts. He says to look closely. As I look back down, I see small groups meeting in homes, in rented churches, or in those Adventist churches that were not harmed. The Herald tells me that these are the remnant of the remnant. These are God\xe2\x80\x99s people who will not bow to false teachings. They faithfully studied the Bible and Spirit of Prophecy for themselves.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-38" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-38\')" >38</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-38" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, pp. 223-224</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tNo name which we can take will be appropriate but that which accords with our profession and expresses our faith and marks us a peculiar people. The name Seventh-day Adventist is a standing rebuke to the Protestant world. Here is the line of distinction between the worshipers of God and those who worship the beast and receive his mark. The great conflict is between the commandments of God and the requirements of the beast. It is because the saints are keeping all ten of the commandments that the dragon makes war upon them. If they will lower the standard and yield the peculiarities of their faith, the dragon will be at peace; but they excite his ire because they have dared to raise the standard and unfurl their banner in opposition to the Protestant world, who are worshiping the institution of papacy.<br /><br />\r\n\t\tThe name Seventh-day Adventist carries the true features of our faith in front, and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow from the Lord\'s quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God\'s law, and will lead to repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-38").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-38", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>As Jesus said, \xe2\x80\x9cMany are called, but few are chosen. Many are called, but few choose.\xe2\x80\x9d Our Father has His people, even though they are few. It will be through them that He will do a mighty work. The Herald states that soon the world will have an opportunity to make their eternal decision. Each will clearly be given a chance to choose between eternal darkness and eternal light. This will be the great shaking, and only the perfect and wholesome wheat will be left. They are the ones whom God can use. The chaff is not useful. The wheat will sow a crop that God can harvest. It is through a purification, through the molding, sifting, and shaking process that God will have a pure church. Though they are few, they will be empowered through the Holy Spirit to do a great work for God.</p>\r\n    <p>Again the Herald and I go higher into the air and watch the earth spin very quickly. When we descend, I notice that many in the United States, including former Seventh-day Adventist leaders and speakers, have made a call to worship on the first day of the week. To promote Sunday worship, laws have been made to keep stores closed on Sunday. On that day, all unnecessary work is prohibited, and everyone is encouraged to worship. As more and more people promote keeping Sunday holy, the movement expands to the rest of the world, and great events are televised to promote it.</p>\r\n    <p>Once again, the Herald takes me higher and I watch the earth spin quickly, then slow down to its normal speed. He informs me that now he will show me something that will fulfill an unconditional promise. However, no one is to know the date when it will happen.</p>\r\n    <p><a href="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/64-Final-Events-and-the-first-supper-4.jpg"><img src="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/64-Final-Events-and-the-first-supper-4.jpg" width="1423" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-193" /></a></p>\r\n\t<p>We descend to a rocky area near the ancient city of Jerusalem. Worldwide television stations have set up cameras to broadcast a special event. Several news reporters announce that the world stands ready for the unveiling of the newly-discovered Ark of the Covenant. Stations present programs on its history, and there is much excitement and discussion. Many speculate regarding the validity and condition of such a great archeological find. As the exact time nears for the Ark to be brought out from its hiding place, the world is focused on the news. Suddenly, we hear an announcement that there is movement deep inside the cave from where the Ark will be carried out for the world to see. Four men are seen slowly and very carefully carrying out the Ark.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-39" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-39\')" >39</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-39" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 4A, p. 102</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tFour heavenly angels always accompanied the ark of God in all its journeyings, to guard it from all danger, and to fulfill any mission required of them in connection with the ark.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-39").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-39", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> The man on the right front corner of the Ark is holding a package in his right hand that contains a video. The Ark is very bright, shiny, and clean. Along each of the two longest sides of the Ark, there is a long pole. The four men carry the Ark by holding onto the ends of the poles. Next, they all stand before a large cluster of microphones. I notice that armed guards quickly surround the Ark and the four men.</p>\r\n    <p>One at a time, each of the four men speaks. They do not talk about themselves but rather about the items they have brought out. They mention that Ron Wyatt, an archeologist from the United States, discovered the Ark and video recorded his find. One of the same four men assured Ron that his video would be shown worldwide.</p>\r\n    <p>A journalist now asks for the names of the four men. As if of one mind, the first man says, \xe2\x80\x9cWho we are,\xe2\x80\x9d and the second man says, \xe2\x80\x9cis not important.\xe2\x80\x9d The third man says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe only name that all should have on their lips is,\xe2\x80\x9d and the fourth individual says, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus, Jesus Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d Then in one voice, all four men simultaneously state, \xe2\x80\x9cThe most wonderful, the most beautiful name in all the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>Another journalist asks what is inside the Ark. One of the men responds that they will open the Ark for the world to see. Another one states that on top of the Ark is the blood that flowed from the side of Jesus while He hung upon the cross and a soldier thrust a spear into His side. Another says that Ron took a sample of the dried blood to a laboratory for testing, and he goes on to share the test results.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-40" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-40\')" >40</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-40" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Desire of Ages, p. 760</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tFrom His hands and feet the blood fell, drop by drop, upon the rock drilled for the foot of the cross.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Matthew 27:51</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAnd, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Manuscript Releases, Vol. 4, p. 243</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tSo Christ, the great antitype, Himself both high priest and victim, clothed with His own spotless robes of righteousness, after giving His life for the world, cast the virtue of His offering, a crimson current, in the direction of the Holy Place, reconciling man to God through the blood of the cross.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 355</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tOn the Day of Atonement two kids of the goats were brought to the door of the tabernacle, and lots were cast upon them, "one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat."

"And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgression in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness."

Reaching inside, one of the men brings out a large, rectangular stone, and another brings out a second stone. Each holds the stone in front of himself. The other two men stand to their left and right. As I observe the two tablets of stone, which are the Ten Commandments, I notice distinct engraving on each one. The lettering looks as if someone had used their finger to write on softened butter. The first letter of each commandment is larger and more deeply engraved. The first tablet displays the first three commandments in a dark purple light. The second tablet displays the last six commandments in a dark blue light. Looking back at the first tablet, I notice that the first three commandments are separated from the fourth commandment, which appears written in a very bright, white light. Now all the colors become brighter.</p>\r\n    <p>Commenting on the Ten Commandments, a news reporter states that they appear to be written in ancient Hebrew. Suddenly, those who are looking at the tablets, whether in person or through the media, notice that they can read the letters in their own language. These Ten Commandments, written by the holy finger of God Himself, are understood by every living soul who is watching anywhere on earth.</p>\r\n    <p>After a little time passes, the last six commandments and then the first three become less bright. However, the fourth commandment becomes brighter and larger in size, and everyone keeps his eyes fixed on it. The letters continue to become a brighter white.</p>\r\n    <p>Next, I am made to know that people in other parts of the world who are sleeping are being shown what is transpiring while they sleep. Many wake up and watch the news on television or via the Internet. Others who do not have that opportunity, such as those camping in the wilderness, in prison, and even the blind, are enabled to see clearly what the fourth commandment states.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\xe2\x80\x9d</blockquote>\r\n    <p>No man, woman, or child on earth, regardless of age or education, will be able to say that he or she had no knowledge of God\xe2\x80\x99s Ten Commandments, especially the fourth. The first three show how we are to reverence God, and the last six show how we are to treat each other. However, the fourth commandment speaks about our Creator and the day that will be kept holy throughout eternity.</p>\r\n    <p>The scene changes, and the Herald and I are standing next to a small stream. He looks down into a valley and beyond, and states that the world will need to make a decision based on what has just been witnessed. That decision will determine their future. For each one it will mean eternal life or eternal death. The Herald mentions that I have already seen that very many Seventh-day Adventists will flee, even from the churches that remain unharmed. He explains that this is the shaking and sifting needed to purify God\xe2\x80\x99s church. He states that Ellen White wrote that the Seventh-day Adventist Church is not Babylon, and that it will not fall. God\xe2\x80\x99s Church will flourish.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald mentions that God has and will have a prepared people, whether they worship at home, in a company of believers, or in a church that does not give in to the demands of corrupt members or leaders. They may meet together with many, in a small group, or even as only a few. Yet they are to know that the Holy Spirit will be there to guide them. These are God\xe2\x80\x99s people armed and ready to war against Satan and his army.</p>\r\n    <p>I am now taken to see those who have God\xe2\x80\x99s mark. They are teaching the truth about what the world just witnessed. They explain that it is time to decide to follow God for eternity or to follow man for a short while. They teach that those who choose eternity with God will find the earthly road difficult to walk on. Those who choose man\xe2\x80\x99s laws and follow the world\xe2\x80\x99s teachings have chosen a smooth road, but it leads downward to eternal death.</p>\r\n    <p>As God\xe2\x80\x99s faithful people continue teaching truth, some travel great distances in a very short time, just as the Bible describes that Philip did. He traveled about 30 miles from Gaza to Ashdod (Azotus) in an instant. God\xe2\x80\x99s faithful will work with the power and might of the Holy Spirit, just like the apostles of Jesus. They will go out armed with the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy. They will have the faith that Jesus asked for, before the evidence was revealed. They have believed God\xe2\x80\x99s messages and now proclaim them to the world. These are the ones who stand in battle to defend God\xe2\x80\x99s name before the universe, and to testify that His laws can and will be kept.</p>\r\n    <p>Time goes by quickly as these faithful ones witness to large crowds of people. Those who are convicted to follow the truth decide to claim the title of Seventh-day Adventist, and God writes that name upon their hearts. At the same time, Satan and those who have committed their lives to follow him have been busy preparing laws that go against God\xe2\x80\x99s laws. Those who keep the seventh-day Sabbath are considered as opposing the teachings of the Roman church that has set up guidelines for Sunday observance.</p>\r\n    <p>Next, a call is made that those who keep Saturday holy are not to be allowed to buy or sell. Quickly an identification (ID) card is introduced to allow only registered Sunday keepers to buy and sell. Credit, debit and gift cards, checks, cash, gold, or silver\xe2\x80\x94any form of payment\xe2\x80\x94is accepted only if an ID card is shown. The card is also needed to pay bills. Those who live in the country, who have a garden and their house and land paid for, are able to provide for themselves temporarily. However, once the card is required by law and their property tax is due, they will be unable to keep their land.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-41" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-41\')" >41</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-41" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Selected Messages, Book 3, pp. 401-402</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAll who have genuine faith will be tested and tried.

The temple courts were polluted with merchandise and robbery. Selfishness and love of mammon, envy and strife, were cherished. Everyone sought for gain from his quarter. Christ turned from them, saying: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem," how can I give thee up? "How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"

At first they will be together with family members, then the spouses will be separated and the children will be taken away. The authorities remind the faithful that God destroyed Seventh-day Adventist facilities, as well as their employees, students, or members. They are told that God took out His wrath on a church that did not observe the first day of the week, and that those who worship on Sunday are being taken care of. I know that God did not destroy the Seventh-day Adventists for Sabbath observance, but rather for transgressing His Word. He destroyed corrupted institutions. I am shocked to see many give up and choose to observe Sunday. Yet, I also see those who know that it is worthwhile to surrender all for Jesus. It is quickly decided that those who choose to ignore the directions of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are to be persecuted and/or killed.</p>\r\n    <p>As shown in the dream \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/28-stand-fast/" target="_blank">Stand Fast</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d many will have to stand in the line where they will surrender all.

Each one will stand before the universe as a witness. These will be called from their temporary grave to meet with Jesus in the air. Then they will take their places on thrones next to God in heaven. These had God\xe2\x80\x99s name engraved in their foreheads, and on their hearts was written the name that God had given to His church\xe2\x94\x80Seventh-day Adventist.</p>\r\n    <p>I now contemplate the difference between those who stand in line as they surrender all and those who simply play church. Their evil worship practices cannot compare to the way the angels of heaven worship. There is no comparison between those Seventh-day Adventists who fled from the burning buildings and those who stand firm for the truth. God\xe2\x80\x99s followers will stand upon the wall of the New Jerusalem to witness Satan\xe2\x80\x99s followers as they stand to receive their punishment. What a contrast between those in Satan\xe2\x80\x99s army who seek to gain all and those in God\xe2\x80\x99s army who surrender all.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald now takes me into the vastness of space within the black veil. Yet even there I see a beauty that is hard to put into words. He reminds me that Ellen White was shown much. Some of the things she was shown were not shared publicly or only shared with specific individuals. This has been the case for me, as well. One of the things Ellen White was shown was that at the very end, God would raise up a prophet who had been named long before he was born. She was instructed not to mention the individual, but his first name, Earnest, and its meaning, truth, were written in the following statement, as well as the fact that he would not be accepted by many.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>Prophecy must be fulfilled. The Lord says, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." Somebody is to come in the spirit and power of Elijah, and when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he</span> appears, men may say, "You are too <span style="text-decoration: underline;">earnest</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you do not interpret the Scriptures in the proper way</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let me tell you how to teach your message</span>." There are many who cannot distinguish between the work of God and that of man. I shall tell the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">truth</span> as God gives it to me, and I say now, If you continue to find fault, to have a spirit of variance, you will never know the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">truth</span>. <em>The Review and Herald, February 18, 1890</em></blockquote>\r\n    <p>The Herald says that most believe that Ellen White was referring to herself in this statement. While she did teach in the spirit and power of Elijah, she was not the prophet for the very end. The Herald reminds me that people have stated that I do not understand the messages I have been given, so they try to correct me. One example comes from the \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/28-stand-fast/" target="_blank">Stand Fast</a>\xe2\x80\x9d dream that mentions the topic of tithe. The leaders immediately claimed that I did not understand this subject, and gave their own interpretation.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald also reminds me about what I recorded in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/54-the-journey-home/" target="_blank">The Journey Home</a>.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <blockquote>I turn to look forward, and the angel tells me that I am being shown something so that I can understand. It is a symbolic example of one of the many things that our Father has planned for those throughout the universe. As we travel, I see what I can only explain as God\xe2\x80\x99s omnipotence. He can do anything with just a word. He now places what looks like all the galaxies throughout the universe in a straight line. His brightness illuminates the universe and we admire how colorful it is. It is as if God has decorated the universe for this grand coronation of the redeemed. There appears to be a row of galaxies on the left and right side of the cloud we are on. It also looks like planets have been extracted from these galaxies and placed next to the galaxies. I now see that God has invited the created beings from these planets to stand next to their planets to observe the coronation.</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The Herald reminds me that I am not to post the dreams until I am instructed to. Also, he reminds me that I was shown in a dream that when Jesus was raised from the tomb, the Father instructed beings from other planets to begin gathering fruit and taking it to the planet where the redeemed will enjoy a Sabbath meal on their seven-day trip to heaven. I also shared this at my meetings. I explained that the food has been sitting there for almost 2000 years, but it is as fresh as if it had just been picked. Even though this dream had not been posted when I shared this, many now serve as witnesses.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-43" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-43\')" >43</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-43" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"> <span class="fn-body">Please note the following quote from the book, <em>The Path to the Throne of God: The Sanctuary</em> by Sarah Elizabeth Peck, p. 232 or on p. 176 at this link:<br /><br />\r\n\t\t<a target="_blank" href="http://www.remnantofgod.org/books/docs/Path%20to%20the%20Throne%20of%20God.pdf">http://www.john1429.org</a><br />\r\n     "As a sort of telescopic side light; we are told on good authority that as the victorious procession of the redeemed, accompanied by all the inhabitants of heaven, journeys forward, \'representatives from all over God\'s universe will line the way on either side of the procession, eager to catch glimpses of the triumphant throng.\' "<br /><br />\r\n \r\nSarah Peck worked on Ellen White\xe2\x80\x99s staff for ten years in Australia. She also helped with the indexing system used at the White Estate. Among other things, she taught at Union College and worked for the Education Department in the California Conference and at the General Conference. She also helped to prepare Ellen White\xe2\x80\x99s book, <em>Education</em>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI believe the \xe2\x80\x9cgood authority\xe2\x80\x9d in the quote above is the same authority that stated the quote below. The Lord showed Ellen White about the representatives from other worlds lining up to see the redeemed, and about the fruit being prepared for the special planet. While her statement was never put into print, she shared it with Jennie Ireland (reported to be her stenographer) and an Elder McClure at her dinner table, shortly before her death. Elder McClure wrote it down and Jennie Ireland reported it. Here is what it states:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"All Heaven was astir making preparations for the coming of the Lord. When Jesus comes, not only do all the angels come with Him, but representatives from all over God\xe2\x80\x99s universe will line the way on either side, from earth to the planet where they are to be entertained. They are lined up on either side, each one anxious to catch the first glimpse of the triumphant throng which Jesus was leading upward. These representatives from all over God\xe2\x80\x99s universe, who are to witness this triumphant march, are now making preparations for their entertainment on a planet where they will spend the Sabbath. They are now bringing fruit from all parts of the universe, from all the other worlds, and storing it on this planet for the Sabbath day\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment of the redeemed. (Rev. 8:1)."<br /><br />\r\nI was shown in this dream that what has been written about the fruit in the Index to the Writings of E. G. White, Vol. 3, Appendix C, p. 3189, was not inspired by the Holy Spirit, but rather consists of what man has decided.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-43").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-43", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script>\r\n</p><p>The Herald now shares that he will show me for the third time what I have seen before, but more details will be added. The first time was in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/1-at-the-table/" target="_blank">At the Table</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d dated May 12, 2005.

The Journey Home" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/54-the-journey-home/" target="_blank">The Journey Home</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d dated May 12, 2011. Here is what I was shown:</p><p>\r\n    </p><blockquote><span class="custom-text-indent">I find myself reclining on my side at a very, very long table. I look across the table and see my mother who is also reclining. My little brother, who died when two years old, is sitting on her lap. He has been placed back in the arms of my faithful mother. I instantly recall her studying the Voice of Prophecy Bible lessons that led her to join the Seventh-day Church. My brothers and I became Seventh-day Adventists because of her faithful instruction. This is why she now sits at this table. To her right, I see a few of my brothers. To her left is my father. To his left are several of my uncles. We talk and laugh.</span><br />\r\n\t<span class="custom-text-indent">As I sit there, I feel unworthy to wear my crown and robe. I remove my robe and lay it next to me. I take off my crown and hand it to my mother. I tell her that I want her to have it, because if it were not for her prayers, I would not be there. She looks at my crown and tells me that she has a crown of her own. Taking it off, she points to some of the stars and says that these represent her sons. She points to one star and tells me, \xe2\x80\x9cThis star represents you. It represents my prayers while I was with you and the petitions that God would be with you when I could not.\xe2\x80\x9d She states that she is most pleased with her crown, that no one else will wear it, and that she will not wear anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s crown. After placing her crown back on her head and picking up my crown, she shows that my crown is different from hers, just as each crown is different from all other crowns. She explains that my crown defines my walk with Jesus and that I am to wear it because He gave it to me. As she hands it back to me, I notice its appearance for the first time. It is made so that many crowns fit inside the crown. Many jewels cover the crown, and light shining through illuminates the jewels and emits a very bright light. I place my crown back on my head, but I still feel unworthy to wear it.</span><br />\r\n\t<span class="custom-text-indent">As I look to the left and right of the table, I see people of different sizes. Some are very tall. I notice that because I am reclining, I cannot see the end of the table in either direction. Looking down at the table in front of me, I see my heavenly name. It is not made of letters but of perfect, bright gold symbols that look engraved and are raised a little above the surface of the table. As I look at my new name, I realize it describes my character, and I repeat to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat describes me; that describes me.\xe2\x80\x9d</span><br />\r\n\t<span class="custom-text-indent">I now hear the most beautiful sound coming from up in the air to my left. I see what I can only describe as long, iridescent birds flying through the air. I do not notice any wings. They sing a most beautiful song in four notes at the same time. It seems that I have only been sitting at the table for a very short time; yet I do not know how long it has been. Before us is a wide selection of fruits, nuts, leaves, and flowers. I understand that even the leaves and flowers are provided as food.</span><br />\r\n\t<span class="custom-text-indent">I now notice the angel who has been standing behind me and to the right. He is the same angel who walked and talked with me on the cloud. He wears a white robe, and his appearance is very noble. He has a kind, gentle smile. I tell him that I now understand he is my guardian angel. I tell him how sorry I am for all that I put him through on earth and that he had to watch me sin. I try to recall my sins, but I cannot. In a gentle voice, he says that I do not need to worry or mention anything about it, because all that is in the past. He explains that when you are forgiven, God forgets your sins.</span><br />\r\n\t<span class="custom-text-indent">My guardian angel places his left hand on my right shoulder, and with his right hand, he motions to the right. He says that Jesus, the Great Host, would have done all that was needed to have me at the table to serve me.</span></blockquote>\r\n    <p><a href="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/64-Final-Events-and-the-first-supper-5.jpg"><img src="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/64-Final-Events-and-the-first-supper-5.jpg" width="1264" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-194" /></a></p>\r\n\t<p>And now in this dream, I look to the far right of the heavenly table and see Jesus filling the goblets. I notice a goblet on the table in front of me. I pick it up to examine it more closely. It is crafted of pure gold. Throughout it are colored jewels that match the jewels on my crown. I see my new name inscribed on a pure diamond inlaid across the middle of my goblet that emits a bright, yellowish gold light. The jewels in each person\xe2\x80\x99s goblet match the jewels in his crown. Each will have his own new name engraved on his goblet. Since those who lived before the Flood were much larger in size than we are today, their crowns and goblets are made to fit their size.</p>\r\n\t<p>I put my goblet back in its place. Looking up, I see Jesus standing directly in front of me. He reaches down and picks up my goblet. I glance to the left and right, and somehow I see Jesus standing before each reclining person. He is serving them all at the same time. I look back up into those eyes that have such peace, and I see the love of the love of the love. As I look up at Him and He looks at me, I hear Him say these words, \xe2\x80\x9cThis grape juice represents My blood.\xe2\x80\x9d He pauses before pouring the juice into my goblet. Then He says, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop of My blood was wasted on the earth, but was placed on the seat of mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n\t<p>Suddenly, I feel the Herald\xe2\x80\x99s hand on my right shoulder, and find that I am slowly ascending. As I look down at the table, I am able to look further down to the left and right of it. I still do not see the end of the table. As we slowly continue to ascend, I am amazed at all the people I see reclining at the table. I notice that the table is located next to the wall inside the Holy City. Those who are closest to the wall look across the table at those reclining, and behind them is the Holy City. Those who recline with their backs toward the Holy City look across the table at those reclining, and behind them is a view of the most amazing and beautifully colored wall. The jewels that make up the wall are hard to describe. Each person is happy with the place chosen for them at the table.</p>\r\n\t<p>As I see those who lived during the days of Adam and Eve, I wonder who I would enjoy being next to at the table. Would it be Adam and Eve, Moses, Abraham and Sarah, Joseph, Noah, David, Elijah, Daniel, John, Joseph and Mary, or Paul? The list could go on and on. I marvel at those of great stature, compared to those who lived after the Flood.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-44" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-44\')" >44</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-44" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 112</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\tBut apart from Bible history, geology can prove nothing.

It is one continuous table that curves around each corner of the Holy City. It is now that I see the ends of the table curve and continue on. Each person\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly name is not only engraved on their goblet, but also on the table where they recline. It is here that Jesus said to everyone at the same time that the grape juice represents His blood, and that not a drop of it was wasted on the earth, but was placed on the seat of mercy. He tells His beloved children to take the grape juice and to drink it.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-45" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-45\')" >45</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-45" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Matthew 26:27-29</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAnd he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

At that point, His work of redemption would soon begin. Now I am observing those for whom He gave His all. Now I am seeing His redeemed in heaven. They are reclining on both sides of the table. They are feasting at their first supper.</p>\r\n    <div class="footnote-reference-heading"><h3></h3></div><div class="footnote-reference-container"><table class="footnote-reference-table"><tbody><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-1">1.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-1\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Signs of the Times, January 2, 1893</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tEveryone who will humble himself as a little child, who will receive and obey the Word of God with a child\'s simplicity will be among the elect of God.</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-2">2.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-2\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 3, p. 295</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tGod distinguished Aaron by choosing him and his male posterity for the priesthood.</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-3">3.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-3\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Leviticus 18:22</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tThou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Leviticus 20:13</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tIf a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Mark 10:6-8</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tBut from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

Just such a work as that which John did, is to be carried on in these last days. The Lord is giving messages to His people, through the instruments He has chosen, and He would have all heed the admonitions and warnings He sends. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Our message is not to be one of peace and safety. As a people who believe in Christ\'s soon appearing, we have a definite message to bear,--"Prepare to meet thy God."<br /><br />\r\n\t\tOur message must be as direct as was that of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding the peril his life was in, he never allowed truth to languish on his lips. Our work in this age must be as faithfully done. . . .<br /><br />\r\n\t\tIn this time of well-nigh universal apostasy, God calls upon His messengers to proclaim His law in the spirit and power of Elias. As John the Baptist, in preparing a people for Christ\'s first advent, called their attention to the Ten Commandments, so we are to give, with no uncertain sound, the message: "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come." With the earnestness that characterized Elijah the prophet and John the Baptist, we are to strive to prepare the way for Christ\'s second advent.</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-35">35.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-35\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 6, p. 420</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAs never before, we should pray not only that laborers may be sent forth into the great harvest field, but that we may have a clear conception of truth, so that when the messengers of truth shall come, we may accept the message and respect the messenger.</span></span></td></tr><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-36">36.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-36\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 403-404</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tDo not the same evils still exist that lay at the foundation of Korah\'s ruin? Pride and ambition are widespread; and when these are cherished, they open the door to envy, and a striving for supremacy; the soul is alienated from God, and unconsciously drawn into the ranks of Satan. Like Korah and his companions, many, even of the professed followers of Christ, are thinking, planning, and working so eagerly for self-exaltation that in order to gain the sympathy and support of the people they are ready to pervert the truth, falsifying and misrepresenting the Lord\'s servants, and even charging them with the base and selfish motives that inspire their own hearts. By persistently reiterating falsehood, and that against all evidence, they at last come to believe it to be truth. While endeavoring to destroy the confidence of the people in the men of God\'s appointment, they really believe that they are engaged in a good work, verily doing God service.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n        <span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 3, p. 350</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAs the children of Israel heard the cry of the perishing ones, they fled at a great distance from them. They knew that they were in a measure guilty, for they had received the accusations against Moses and Aaron, and they were afraid that they should also perish with them. The judgment of God was not yet finished. A fire came from the cloud of glory and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. They were princes; that is, men generally of good judgment, and of influence in the congregation, men of renown. They were highly esteemed, and their judgment had often been sought in difficult matters. But they were affected by a wrong influence, and became envious, jealous and rebellious. They perished not with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, because they were not the first in rebellion. They were to see their end first, and have an opportunity of repenting of their crime. But they were not reconciled to the destruction of those wicked men, and the wrath of God came upon them, and destroyed them also.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n     <span class="fn-ref">Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 635 </span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tNo stronger evidence can be given of Satan\'s delusive power than that many who are thus led by him deceive themselves with the belief that they are in the service of God. When Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against the authority of Moses, they thought they were opposing only a human leader, a man like themselves; and they came to believe that they were verily doing God service. But in rejecting God\'s chosen instrument they rejected Christ; they insulted the Spirit of God. So, in the days of Christ, the Jewish scribes and elders, who professed great zeal for the honor of God, crucified His Son. The same spirit still exists in the hearts of those who set themselves to follow their own will in opposition to the will of God.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5, p. 212</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tIt is with reluctance that the Lord withdraws His presence from those who have been blessed with great light and who have felt the power of the word in ministering to others.
