Some began on February 18, 2013. Some of the dreams were about specific individuals within the ministry. I was not to contact these individuals unless instructed to. It is now time to post these messages from the heavenly Father.</p>\r\n    <p>In my dream, the guide angel stands behind me with his left hand on top of my right shoulder and his right arm pointing to the sky. He states my heavenly name and instructs me to notice the sky, which is black or gray and sometimes a dark purple. Once in a while a bright yellow ribbon of lightning streaks through the sky followed by a thunderous roar. The guide continues by sharing that God is love and all-patient, but there is an end to His patience.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-1" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-1\')" >1</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-1" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 356-357</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n         There will soon be a sudden change in God\'s dealings.

I now see a very large volcano that is not erupting with a fiery blast. Instead, the boiling lava simply flows from an opening. The lava is white with heat, and the air around it is polluted. The guide says that this is how we should perceive God\xe2\x80\x99s anger over the things He witnesses on this earth.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p><a href="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/69-God-is-angry-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/69-God-is-angry-3.jpg" width="1179" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" /></a></p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>The angel points in another direction, and I see a large body of water that represents a pond, a lake, or an ocean. The water is boiling, not just on the surface but even down to the very bottom. The steam that rises into the air is so hot that even it appears to be boiling. The angel says that this is another way to describe God\xe2\x80\x99s anger.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p><a href="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/69-God-is-angry-4.jpg"><img src="http://www.formypeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/69-God-is-angry-4.jpg" width="1172" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" /></a></p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>Next, the guide points in another direction. I see a road made of concrete. Instead of being hard, it is boiling. Large bubbles break open on the road\xe2\x80\x99s surface, which appears to have melted. The angel says to look again. I see a black, asphalt road. It also becomes hot, and the surface begins to bubble. The angel repeats that this is another way to show God\xe2\x80\x99s anger.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide again points to the sky and says to look up and understand. I notice what I know to be airwaves from a video that is being played either at one of the apostasy-driven Seventh-day Adventist worship services, or on one of their many telecasts. Rather than showing a reverent video, such as a nature movie, it is simply entertainment. He says to notice the instruments and the way the individuals perform. We are to know that these things anger the heavenly Father who sits on His holy throne, He who is worthy of divine, sacred worship.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide tells me to look again. Now I see what I can only describe as different music wave patterns scrolling across the sky. Suddenly, I am able to hear all the music all at once. Yet, I can differentiate each of the sound patterns. The angel explains that this is a representation of most Seventh-day Adventist radio or television programs. With disappointment, he says that even though these claim to be doing God\xe2\x80\x99s work, they are not always reverent.</p><p>The guide explains that a model of sacred worship is found in the courts of heaven. Enough examples have been shared through the Bible, the Spirit of Prophecy, and For My People Ministry. Is the music being used sacred to God\xe2\x80\x99s ears, or is it just pleasing to those who want to hear it? Is it sacred music to worship the heavenly Father, or is it for entertainment?</p>\r\n\t<p>The angel shares that there are other things which God is angry about. We begin walking and he tells me that Protestants, including Seventh-day Adventists, are taking up the banner of women serving as ordained elders and pastors. In the Garden of Eden, Adam was instituted as the priest of the family, and this role was passed on solely to his male offspring. God never ordained women as priests; therefore, it is not to be done. It is a deception of Satan. Now most Protestants no longer promote the ideals their churches were founded on. Cain, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, and his priestly line all offered sacrifices, but it was never given to women to serve as priests or to officiate in the services of the sanctuary, or now in the churches. God is not the only One who calls individuals to ministry. Satan also does, in order to lead the church astray and confuse its members.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, the guide says to notice a contrast between Protestants and Catholics. Protestants, including Adventists, used to worship reverently, but the majority no longer does.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-3" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-3\')" >3</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-3" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Selected Messages, Book 2, p. 367</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tThe professed Protestant world will form a confederacy with the man of sin [the papacy], and the church and the world will be in corrupt harmony.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-3").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-3", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Even though the Catholic Church is Satan\xe2\x80\x99s counterfeit of God\xe2\x80\x99s Church, it is interesting to note that the majority of its members still hold reverent services. There is no rock music with drums and electric guitars, no praise or gospel singers performing, no waving of hands or praise dancing, and no loud talking or running in the sanctuary.</p>\r\n\t<p>The angel now asks something very specific: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes the Catholic Church ordain women priests?\xe2\x80\x9d No, it does not. Additionally, no woman priest is ever mentioned in the Bible. Protestants used to protest, but now they conduct irreverent worship services and ordain women as pastors. Satan has brought in a creeping compromise to lower the high standards and change the doctrines.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-4" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-4\')" >4</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-4" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">2 Timothy 4:3-4</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">The Signs of the Times, February 19, 1894</span><span class="fn-body"> The church that holds to the word of God is irreconcilably separated from Rome.

Rome never changes. Her principles have not altered in the least. She has not lessened the breach between herself and Protestants; they have done all the advancing. But what does this argue for the Protestantism of this day? It is the rejection of Bible truth which makes men approach to infidelity. It is a backsliding church that lessens the distance between itself and the Papacy.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-4").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-4", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> This has led people down his path\xe2\x80\x94a path that leads opposite to heaven.

As he raises his arm, I see different kinds of animals, each created for mating and reproducing. He shows me a depiction of Adam in the Garden of Eden. He is noticing that each animal has a mate. The angel shows me that God created and designed Eve to be the mate for Adam. He explains that the Creator did not make another man for Adam, and that even in nature there is a correct balance.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, the guide angel illustrates how electricity has positive and negative components. The earth has positive and negative magnetic poles. If there were no opposite poles, the earth could not spin on its axis. God never intended two negatives or two positives to work together. Throughout the universe, this was never a part of His design. Then I see the angel holding a flashlight. It emits light because its batteries contain positive and negative poles. He explains that with two positive or two negative poles, no light would be emitted. Without opposites, there is only darkness.</p>\r\n\t<p>I understand that in all of God\xe2\x80\x99s nature there is a balance between the negative and the positive. Lightning results from an electrical discharge produced to balance the differences between negative and positive charges in a cloud. Sometimes the charge occurs between the cloud and the ground, or it could happen between two clouds. In fact, we could not have thunder without lightning.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide angel puts a hand on my shoulder and says that I was already shown in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/44-the-end/" title="44. The End" target="_blank">The End</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d that homosexuality is not genetic. The following was stated by the Herald:</p>\r\n\t<p class="quote">The Creator then commanded that these two [Adam and Eve] in their marital union, through the holy institution of marriage, be fruitful and multiply. They were to populate the earth. They were not created with a genetic makeup of a man and a man or a woman and a woman to live in this holy union or to have a sexual relationship. The Great Founder created a perfect union between a man and a woman, between a husband and a wife in the sanctity He called marriage. He never created a genetic makeup that results in a life of homosexuality. Those who have chosen this path have not chosen it because of an inherited trait or a genetic disorder. It is not anything that is connected with the Creator\xe2\x80\x99s grand design. Those who live this style of life live it because of what they have chosen. It is not through what was created. Those in a position of counsel who did not assist in correcting those who lived that lifestyle, those that endorsed it and spoke smooth, soft things will give an account to the Great Judge.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide angel continues to explain that homosexuality is a choice that God\xe2\x80\x99s grace does not cover. Would we be expected to be accepting of serial killers, because we are told that they are born that way? Would it be acceptable to welcome them into our churches, pat them on the back, and then point them to the children\xe2\x80\x99s classrooms? The practice of homosexuality is not to be accepted. God is angry over this acceptance.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, the angel leads me to a large field. In front of me I notice what looks like a large, three-story projection screen. He mentions future events that were shown in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/64-final-events-and-the-first-supper/" title="64. Final Events and the First Supper" target="_blank">Final Events and the First Supper</a>.\xe2\x80\x9d He tells me that we have been shown the Father\xe2\x80\x99s patience with those who have openly spoken against His messages and His messenger. He talks about the many times God invited them to ask for His forgiveness for sinning and letting their own desires get in the way of obedience. He speaks about how they openly condemned me as God\xe2\x80\x99s messenger, because I documented the false teachings of those who claim to teach truth. Additionally, most people do not think to expose the false teachers who condemn the messages of eternal salvation that God has given me to share.</p>\r\n\t<p>My guide angel pauses and reminds me of something that I have already been shown in my dreams. Soon the ground will obey the voice of the Creator. It will open and slowly devour those who have discredited, defamed, and condemned God\xe2\x80\x99s messages and messengers. It will be their just reward. They will be swallowed up like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

History will be repeated.</p>\r\n\t<blockquote><span class="custom-text-indent">In the name of the God of Israel, Moses now declared, in the hearing of the congregation: "Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me.

I see a depiction of sinkholes around the world. He shares that these are examples of the ground opening and devouring individuals, whether it is while they sleep in their beds, work in their yards, walk across a golf course, or drive down a road. God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath is witnessed upon those who continue to sin against Him.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide lowers his arm, turns to me and says that soon each of the critics spoken of in the Truth book, as well as others who mock God\xe2\x80\x99s messages, will receive God\xe2\x80\x99s justice. Heaven is aware of certain Seventh-day Adventist pastors, not mentioned in the Truth book, who have mockingly stated that they should be added to the list of corrupt pastors. If these pastors do not repent, they will be devoured as a result of God\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. These critics will be swallowed up because of their own sins, and they will hear the cries of those they misled. And God is angry.</p>\r\n\t<p>No unjust person can or will be excused from unconfessed sins. Know that the theme in my messages from God has been the patience of the Father, the love of Jesus, and the pleadings of the Holy Spirit. Over and over again, the messages have called for repentance, and urged everyone to test all things with the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald now descends and reveals that there are individuals in the Seventh-day Adventist organization that serve a master who is not the true God, because they are Jesuit infiltrators. He instructs that I am not to share their names. While most members do not know their true work or identity, the heavenly Father, who is the Alpha and Omega, knows who they are and the instructions they receive from the pope. He knows about their infiltration into Protestantism, which includes Seventh-day Adventists. He knows about the directions they are giving. The Herald says that the Great Mapmaker knows the road they take and where that road ends.</p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald tells me that God is angry.

His patience has been tried. Even though God is love and Jesus pleads through His blood, the critics will meet their judgment. That time is near. Each was instructed to prepare, to repent, to test God\xe2\x80\x99s messages, and to examine their own hearts. Look for their just reward, because God is angry.</p>\r\n\t<p>My dream changes and I stand looking up a gradual, upward-sloping hill, which has a most beautiful, crystal clear, cascading stream coming down over rocks. Along both sides of the stream are trees, flowers, and thick, luscious, dark green grass. Silently, the guide angel and I begin to walk upward alongside the stream. The air is cool and smells fresh and rich with oxygen. As we reach the top of the hill, I look down into a hole where all the water is coming from. The water is crystal clear and smells fresh.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-10" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-10\')" >10</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-10" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Manuscript Releases, Vol. 11, p. 239</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tGod wants you to come and drink of the clear waters of the streams of Lebanon, and when you have drunk yourselves you will want to call others to drink.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-10").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-10", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n\t<p>Suddenly, the stream of water slows its flow out of the hole. It is as if a valve is gradually being turned off. Then the water completely stops flowing, and there is complete silence. My guide breaks the silence and says that water flows like the Holy Spirit. There is life as long as the Holy Spirit flows. Where He is absent, there is only death and decay.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, I notice all kinds of garbage and trash coming up from the hole. It is as if the earth is spitting out the trash that has been created and dumped. I see all forms of broken and shredded plastic, pieces of paper, cardboard boxes, and empty cigarette packets. Then I see something that makes me look more closely. It is a very old, hand-blown, Coca-Cola bottle from the late 1800s that would have contained syrup sold for medicinal purposes. The bottle comes up from under the ground with mud and other muck. It is interesting to note that in the late 1800s, Ellen White wrote much about the backsliding in the Seventh-day Adventist organization.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-11" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-11\')" >11</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-11" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Review and Herald, January 19, 1897</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tBut there is backsliding among us, and God is dishonored.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-11").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-11", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> How much worse is it today?</p>\r\n\t<p>My dream changes again and there are two angels present. While the guide angel explains to me about Moses and Aaron, the announcing angel listens. I am enabled to visualize the illustration in my mind.

They were not to question or doubt, but to trust what he said and act upon it.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-12" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-12\')" >12</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-12" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Manuscript Releases, Vol. 16, p. 113</span><span class="fn-body"> The levity of some, the free speeches of others, the manner of treating the messenger and the message when in their private stopping places, the spirit that stirred to action from beneath, all stand registered in the books of heaven.

With his rod in his hand, he turned and faced a giant boulder. He was very angry as he yelled and swore at the Israelites. He did not just tap the boulder. Instead of speaking to it, as God had commanded, he furiously hit it. Then I saw water coming out. The people were to listen to Moses because he was the mouthpiece of God.</p>\r\n\t<p>The next part of this dream has specific information that is necessary for certain individuals. It is so important that it was given by God to the Herald, who is Gabriel, and then to the announcing angel to deliver. Until now, I did not know his position as an angel. I thought he was low in rank and would simply deliver messages as he was instructed. I already knew that the Herald is Gabriel. However, I am now shown that the announcing angel is very important, yet very humble. He stands to the right of Gabriel. Before the war in heaven, Lucifer stood next to God\xe2\x80\x99s throne, and Gabriel stood next to Lucifer.</p>\r\n\t<p>The guide angel stays while the announcing angel steps forward and begins to speak. He tells me that the Father called him before the throne. He was instructed to go immediately to share what I am to know. He tells me that two brothers, Chris and Nelson, were given an invitation to serve as pastors with the For My People Ministry. However, they were to wait until they were ready and called to serve as pastors. As they waited, they were to humble themselves before God. It was to be a time of learning and testing for both. However, I am shown that they did not humble their hearts.</p>\r\n\t<p>The prayers of many on behalf of Chris and Nelson have been heard. The announcing angel explains that Jesus went before His heavenly Father to plead on their behalf. Jesus explained that these two did not realize the danger they were in. He pleaded for God to forgive them and give them another chance.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-13" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-13\')" >13</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-13" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">2 Peter 3:9</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tThe Lord is\xe2\x80\xa6longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-13").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-13", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Jesus was the One who invited them to serve as pastors.

The announcing angel shares that the Father gave the brothers another chance, but said that if they failed again, He would personally remove the invitation from their hands. It was stated that He has a timetable, and if they did not follow His instructions, He would quickly move on to others He has waiting.</p>\r\n\t<p>The angel stresses that when God\xe2\x80\x99s messengers share His instructions, He expects them to be heeded. If He sends a message through one of His angels, and the messenger who receives it does not give the message, He will move on to another messenger. When the message is given, if the individual receiving it does not heed it, or if he begins to doubt and speak against the messenger, God will move on to someone else. The Father\xe2\x80\x99s timetable must be followed.</p>\r\n\t<p>The announcing angel explains that in the dream I shared with Chris and Nelson, they were both to wait outside while a symbolic building was being built. They were to be lieutenants in waiting. The building under construction did not represent a church, but rather symbolized that they were not yet ready to serve. They both needed to learn and grow spiritually. Because the brothers refused to accept this, they discredited the messenger.</p>\r\n\t<p>Another example comes from a dream where I am slowly walking up a path. The Herald, the guide, and the announcing angels are following me. As I walk, on each side of the path are depictions that mark important events in the development of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. I stop at each place to review and study God\xe2\x80\x99s perfect guidance in the development of His church. At each stopping place of my ascent, I notice that it is very bright, and I understand it to be the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>\r\n\t<p>As I continue up the path, the grass becomes greener and more lush. Different types of decorations, such as flowers, colorful bushes, and small, very colorful trees, adorn each side of the path.</p>\r\n\t<p>Continuing on, I notice that the path ends at the top of a cliff. I see an elevation sign that reads \xe2\x80\x9c1951.\xe2\x80\x9d (This is the time when doctrinal changes on the nature of sin and the nature of Christ were being made.)</p>\r\n\t<p>At the top of the cliff, the path drops straight down, so I turn and make a sharp right. In this instance, I know that the right turn does not represent good or that a left turn means the wrong way. The path simply goes to the right and then gradually slopes downward. Now the lush green path and beautiful flowers and trees begin to turn brown. The scenery is no longer beautiful. The depictions that marked important events guided by God disappear and change to those created by man. I see the glorification of man, not of God, such as someone receiving a plaque for doing community service work. Why should a person receive an award for helping someone in need? As I continue further down, weeds grow and the grass dries up from lack of water and nutrients. Then the path becomes barren, and there are only rocks, stones, and dirt.</p>\r\n\t<p>Jesus now comes to walk with me on this path for a short time. He says that many still do not comprehend that His church is not a building or an establishment. God\xe2\x80\x99s true church is comprised of individuals and small groups that worship only Him. They believe in the true teachings of Jesus as shown in the Bible, and uphold His testimonies, which are the Spirit of Prophecy.

Tragically, they have returned to their previous Seventh-day Adventist church, joining in the celebration and apostasy even after receiving such great light through the For My People Ministry.

However, I will only share the latter one, because the first only showed the younger brother, Chris, while the latter showed both brothers. I was not to share it at the time I received it, but was to wait until the instructed time, which is now. It is very difficult for me to have to share this.</p>\r\n\t<p>In this dream, I stand by what I know to be a lake covered with thin ice. I see Jesus standing and holding a large, leather medical bag in His left hand. In the bag I see a young woman I know. There are also others in the bag, but I do not see their faces. In His right hand, Jesus holds two threads. One of the threads is attached to Chris, and the other to Nelson. I notice that the brothers tie a very short, black rope to each other. They begin walking toward the partially-frozen lake, while Jesus holds tightly to both threads. It looks like He is trying to keep them from going onto the lake. I look back at the medical bag, and for the first time I notice the words \xe2\x80\x9cFor My People Ministry\xe2\x80\x9d written on it. It is then I realize that the people in the medical bag are some of those God has called to serve in this ministry.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, I notice Chris and Nelson as they carefully walk out onto the thin ice. Just below the surface, there are many spears that point upwards. Each spear tip is razor-sharp. They will not only cut, sever, and shred, but each one also has a flame of fire to consume. As Chris and Nelson continue to walk slowly, they somehow reach out with their left hands and grab the young woman in the medical bag. They quickly pull her out, along with others, and instantly their two threads break. (Now I know that in real life, Chris and Nelson have been contacting individuals through social media.) Suddenly, the ice breaks and Chris and Nelson sink below the surface. I notice that the young woman and the others no longer appear in the dream, but I am made to understand that neither she nor the others went down into the water. I now look below the surface and see that as Chris and Nelson sink to the bottom, their invitations to serve are shredded and burning. God has reluctantly let them go, fulfilling His promise. He will do the same to others who trample His messages and condemn His messengers.</p>\r\n\t<p>I turn back to look at Jesus and hear Him say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because of their actions that I will require their blood for attacking My ministry and trying to deceive those who serve Me.\xe2\x80\x9d As I look into those eyes where I always see the love of the love of the love, I notice tears streaming down His face. In a strange way, freedom is love. Love provides the freedom to choose eternal life or eternal death. Now Jesus says, \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed be the ones who believe before the evidence mounts.\xe2\x80\x9d<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-16" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-16\')" >16</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-16" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Instructor, January 10, 1901</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tIt is of great importance that we have a faith that will not wait for the evidence of sight before it ventures to advance. </span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">The Signs of the Times, August 11, 1898</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\t...those who think it impossible to yield to the will of God until all is made clear and plain before them, will never yield at all.

I also notice that the Holy Spirit is sent to stand next to the young woman. I am shown that Chris and Nelson had been sending messages to this young lady to pull her away from a work God has called her to do. The angels, as well as the Holy Spirit, become a fortress around her. Instantly, I see her sitting in a large pasture with many, many sheep. As loudly as she can, she is singing the hymn, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Sunshine in My Soul Today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n\t<p style="text-align: center;">There\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine in my soul today,<br /> More glorious and bright<br /> Than glows in any earthly sky,<br /> For Jesus is my light.\xc2\xa0</p>\r\n\t<p style="text-align: center;">Refrain<br /> O there\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine, blessed sunshine,<br /> When the peaceful, happy moments roll;<br /> When Jesus shows His smiling face,<br /> There is sunshine in the soul.</p>\r\n\t<p style="text-align: center;">There\xe2\x80\x99s music in my soul today,<br /> A carol to my King,<br /> And Jesus, listening, can hear<br /> The songs I cannot sing.<br />Refrain</p>\r\n\t<p style="text-align: center;">There\xe2\x80\x99s springtime in my soul today,<br /> For, when the Lord is near,<br /> The dove of peace sings in my heart,<br /> The flowers of grace appear.<br />Refrain</p>\r\n\t<p style="text-align: center;">There\xe2\x80\x99s gladness in my soul today,<br /> And hope and praise and love,<br /> For blessings which He gives me now,<br /> For joys \xe2\x80\x9claid up\xe2\x80\x9d above.<sup><a href="#b1">*</a></sup></p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald descends again and addresses me by my heavenly name. Behind and to the right of the Herald is the announcing angel. To his left is the guide angel. The Herald tells me that what the Father promised, He fulfilled. He reminds me that Jesus went before His heavenly Father and pleaded on behalf of Chris and Nelson. He pleaded that God would forgive them and give them another chance.</p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald again shares that the Father decided to give them another chance, but if they failed again, He would personally remove the invitation from their hands. It was stated that He has a timetable, and if they did not respond according to God\xe2\x80\x99s directions, He would quickly move on to others He has waiting. And He has already begun to do so. The Herald explains that when God\xe2\x80\x99s messenger speaks, God expects His instructions to be heeded. If He sends a message and it is not heeded, He will move on to others, which He is doing. The Father\xe2\x80\x99s timetable, His schedule, must be followed. \xc2\xa0The Herald tells me that this is why he has been sent to show me God\xe2\x80\x99s decision.

Not only was time spent teaching them, but financial aid was also provided. Because Nelson was having employment problems, he and his family were given a good vehicle so they could travel and do what God asked them to do. Money was provided to help with the burden of their unpaid bills. A computer was given to him to help with his studies, research, and sermon preparation. On two separate occasions, Nelson claimed that he took the ministry computer to a pawn shop in order to get money to pay his bills. The ministry provided additional funds to help with food, gas, and medical expenses for him and his family. Amazingly, he now proclaims that this ministry is of Satan. Yet he has no problem keeping the items he received from this ministry, because he states that God provided them for him. If this ministry is not of God, as Nelson claims, how could God have provided those things for him? It would mean that Satan provided those things for Nelson. Confusion comes from the devil. It is clearly evident that God was patient with Nelson.</p>\r\n\t<p>Chris also has had employment problems and received much financial assistance from the ministry. Among other things, he received help to repair his car in order to find employment to provide for his family. Due to his debts, he was given funds to purchase food and other necessities for himself and his family. Like Nelson, he now speaks openly against this ministry and the messages. He and Nelson have \xe2\x80\x9cbitten\xe2\x80\x9d the very hand of the One who was feeding them. It is clearly evident that God was also patient with Chris.</p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald now reveals that God\xe2\x80\x99s patience and His giving have run out for Chris and Nelson.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-19" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-19\')" >19</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-19" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Signs of the Times, November 15, 1899</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\t...if men continue to resist light and evidence, they will cut themselves off from God\'s mercy, and then will come the ministry of wrath. ...The love of God is immeasurable to those who repent, but His justice is firm and uncompromising to those who abuse his long-suffering love.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-19").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-19", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> God has also commanded that the Holy Spirit no longer walk with them, and that all His angels be removed from their presence. As long as Chris and Nelson walk on this earth, they no longer will have heaven\xe2\x80\x99s protection. God no longer sees their tears or hears their prayers. Jesus no longer hears their supplications. Angels no longer record their pleas. They have both committed the unpardonable sin \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew 12:31.</p>\r\n\t<p>The Herald points up to what looks like a white screen. He begins to recite the Spirit of Prophecy quote below that discusses sinning against the Holy Spirit. When he gets to the bolded part, I instantly remember those who called the Herald as being of Satan. Yet we have been shown that he is Gabriel.</p>\r\n\t<blockquote>What constitutes the sin against the Holy Ghost? It is willfully attributing to Satan the work of the Holy Spirit. For example, suppose that one is a witness of the special work of the Spirit of God. He has convincing evidence that the work is in harmony with the Scriptures, and the Spirit witnesses with his spirit that it is of God. Afterward, however, he falls under temptation; pride, self-sufficiency, or some other evil trait, controls him; and rejecting all the evidence of its divine character, he declares that that which he had before acknowledged to be the power of the Holy Spirit was the power of Satan. It is through the medium of His Spirit that God works upon the human heart; and <strong>when men willfully reject the Spirit and declare it to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can communicate with them.</strong> By denying the evidence which God has been pleased to give them, they shut out the light which had been shining in their hearts, and as the result they are left in darkness. Thus the words of Christ are verified: "If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!" Matthew 6:23. For a time, persons who have committed this sin may appear to be children of God; but when circumstances arise to develop character and show what manner of spirit they are of, it will be found that they are on the enemy\'s ground, standing under his black banner. <em>Counsels for the Church</em>, p. 81</blockquote>\r\n\t<p>I am shown that because of the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 positions as husbands and fathers of their households, their decisions affect their families.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-20" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-20\')" >20</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-20" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">The Youth\xe2\x80\x99s Instructor, February 8, 1894</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tHow terrible were the consequences of this man\'s [Achan\xe2\x80\x99s] sin.

This agrees with the fact that we are not born guilty or sinful. We must choose to sin before God sees us as guilty.

I do not see it literally. I am standing in what I know to be heaven. In front of me are three very majestic thrones. I know that even the thrones are holy. Around the three thrones stand many and many beyond many angels, each waiting to do a bidding, to serve. The heavenly Father sits on the middle throne. If I literally saw the Father in my present state on this earth, I know I would be consumed. Jesus sits on the right side of the Father\xe2\x80\x99s throne. The Holy Spirit sits on the left side of the Father\xe2\x80\x99s throne. He has a tangible, physical body, yet He can be everywhere at the same time. I now seem to know that the three chimes represent the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit who sit before me. Although They are three separate Persons, They are as one, and separately declare the sound of a chime.</p>\r\n\t<p>My mind returns to the thought of how many times Jesus has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cWill I find faith when I return?\xe2\x80\x9d And yet He has stated that those who believe before the evidence mounts are blessed. I think about those words over and over again. If we had evidence for everything, there would be no need for faith. I realize that what Jesus said could also be phrased in a different way: Cursed be the ones who do not believe even after the evidence is shown.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-28" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-28\')" >28</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-28" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Manuscript Releases, Vol. 4, p. 330</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tUnless the human agent inclines his heart to do God\'s will, and takes up God\'s service, the light will shine in vain.

I am now presented with a message to end this compilation of dreams. In this dream, I am made to understand that after the righteous have occupied heaven for 1,000 years, Jesus will destroy all evil through the power of the heavenly Father. The whole earth will be destroyed, down to its very core. Even the place where Jesus will set His feet to level the Mount of Olives into a great plain for the Holy City will be destroyed. In this dream, I again see what I saw before in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="21. The New Earth" href="http://www.formypeople.org/dream/21-the-new-earth/" target="_blank">The New Earth</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d when our surrounding planets will be destroyed.

They will all be completely destroyed, including Satan and his evil angels. After they are destroyed, the cleansing flames will continue to burn the earth, until nothing is left. The flames will consume the first heaven until every trace of sin is removed from the universe. Then Jesus will command that there be a new heaven and a new earth, because the former will have been destroyed in the cleansing fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.\xe2\x80\x9d Revelation 21:1.</p>\r\n\t<p>Even though everything evil will be consumed, it will be a time of great sorrow, because it will be a time to witness the destruction of certain family or church members, friends, or acquaintances. It will include those who opposed God\xe2\x80\x99s last-day messages, those who rejected God\xe2\x80\x99s gift of eternal life. I see Jesus everywhere comforting the saints.

We will always be together because we want to be. Jesus comes over and calls us by our heavenly names. It is difficult to understand, but as before I am made to know that our names are synonymous, yet singular. We will be two different people, but addressed the same way.</p>\r\n\t<p>Jesus tells us that He knows about a place that we both want to build. However, it will not be ours, but rather a special place for all the redeemed. He invites us to go, and says that He has assigned a large company of angels to go with us to help with the construction. He tells us that He also will be with us to help, and that He waits for our design with anticipation. I know that the "our" refers to the design made by Jesus, Becky, and me.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, Becky and I look at each other, and instead of walking away, we fly together very quickly. We both know what we are looking for. The place we want must have a very large hill behind it. Looking out and away from the hill, there must be a great flowered plain and valley. In the distance there must be a majestic waterfall that fills a beautiful lake.</p>\r\n\t<p>After much searching, we find a place we know will be perfect. It has a large hill with trees and a stream flowing from it. The stream continues down the hill into the valley and along a great flowered plain. Beyond that is a waterfall that forms a large, beautiful lake. We both know this is the place where we will build. So Becky and I tell Jesus and our assisting angels that this is the place where we would like to build. Jesus replies, \xe2\x80\x9cLet it be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n\t<p>I turn to Jesus and tell Him that because there is so much water flowing out of the large, lush hillside, I need Him to stop the water from flowing for a while.

We know that this will be a place where the redeemed can come to walk, rest, and contemplate what Jesus did for each of them. Inhabitants from other worlds as well will come here to visit and speak with the redeemed. This place will be an eternal testament to the universe of our Savior\xe2\x80\x99s incredible love.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, Becky and I know that the mansion will need to be made of transparent matter, so that from the inside everyone can have a clear view of the beauty outside. Jesus, the Great Creator, steps forward and tells us with a smile that He knows exactly what we need. He says to notice the clear water that always flows.</p>\r\n\t<p>Jesus puts out His ever-creating hand, and before us appear many, many stacks of what I know to be congealed water.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-38" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-38\')" >38</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-38" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Exodus 15:8</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tAnd with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n\t\t<span class="fn-ref">Psalm 104:3</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n\t\tWho layeth the beams of his [God\xe2\x80\x99s] chambers in the waters\xe2\x80\xa6.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-38").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-38", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Each slab of crystal clear water is thick, long, and wide.

If a slab is too long, we simply use our hands to slice through it. If it is too short, we can stretch it to the desired length, and it never loses its thickness.</p>\r\n\t<p>The angels, who love to help, enjoy assisting us with the construction. It is their nature to serve. Becky and I talk to Jesus constantly about how we would like the mansion to be. Then it is as if Jesus instantly places the ideas into the minds of the angels, who are very quick to help lay the foundation and build this enormous place. It has many, many rooms. The size of the mansion and the land it sits on are too large to describe. Each room will always have a picture window view, no matter where a person is inside the mansion. The design is perfected by the Great Creator.</p>\r\n\t<p>The floor in the mansion is seamless, soft, and made up of yellow, red, and blue slabs. As a person walks across the floor, it turns many different colors, which are a constant reminder of the great rainbow that forms over the throne of the King of the Universe.</p>\r\n\t<p>After the walls are constructed, each room is filled with furniture made from the bendable slabs that form to a person\xe2\x80\x99s size. When the angels complete the construction of the roof, we all gaze at this place that will always remind everyone of Jesus. It reminds us that He is the Living Water. This place is composed of living water sustained by the Creator. He spoke, and the water formed.</p>\r\n\t<p>To the left of the mansion, we design a great trench laid with long slabs of congealed water. The slabs will protect the earth when water begins to flow out of the hill and down into the trench. The angels help dig the trench, and again, there are no seams.</p>\r\n\t<p>Next, Becky and I talk with Jesus about our idea of forming vertical walls of congealed water to make a very large aquarium many miles in length. Jesus agrees with it. We tell Him that we would like new and different plants and coral reefs in the aquarium. Those new creations will be unique, because there will be no others like them in the entire universe. Becky and I have another request, and Jesus agrees with it by also creating unique creatures for the aquarium.</p>\r\n\t<p>Benches are made and placed next to the aquarium for relaxing while viewing the creations. Then we tell Jesus that under the aquarium we would like tunnels, also made of congealed water, for people to walk through to get a different perspective of the underwater world. A person would even be able to pass through the aquarium walls and swim with the creatures, or fly through the air and dive into the aquarium.</p>\r\n\t<p>In front of the mansion, we form a long walkway that goes down toward the valley below. It is made of the same material as the mansion floor. Becky plants a tree in front of the entryway that grows into two trunks, one trunk on either side of the walkway. She trains the branches to grow up along the walkway so that they form an archway of tree limbs that frame the waterfall in the valley below. The tree produces multi-colored leaves and flowers, and a variety of fruits hangs from its branches.</p>\r\n\t<p>When the mansion and landscaping are completed, multitudes come to visit, even from the far reaches of the universe. As they discuss and contemplate what the Savior did for mankind and why He did it, they are amazed by the depth of the love of the love of the love. Because of this love, they want to continue sharing it with others, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you about Jesus.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n\t<p>This mansion is not just for Becky and me, but for all the faithful. It is a place to walk hand in hand with Jesus. It is a place to remember the scars in His head, His hands, His feet, and His side. As I was shown in my dream, \xe2\x80\x9c<a title="60.
