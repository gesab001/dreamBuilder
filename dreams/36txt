As I reach down and cup a handful of sand, I notice that each grain is very small. I think how Jesus created each to be so finite but without even that one grain of sand the beach would be smaller. I feel the warmth of the sun on my face and hear birds singing. The air is filled with the scent of the ocean and different flowers. I now look over the whole scene before me and think how the beauty on this earth does not compare with heaven.</p>\r\n    <p>My thoughts are broken by a voice speaking to me. I turn around and see the Herald standing very close behind me. Speaking my heavenly name, he says it is time now to return to where I was before, as he is to show the rest of what I was seeing. I am to take special note of everything, since there will be much to see. He first requests to take my right hand so that we can travel somewhere. As I extend my right hand to him, he takes it and instantly we now stand on the side of a very large mountain. The air smells very unpleasant, resembling sin and a polluted world. As I look around I know this is the same place from the dreams \xe2\x80\x9cRepent, as I am Coming\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWatch, as I am Coming.\xe2\x80\x9d I remember before seeing a small group who were part of many small groups around the world and compose the 144,000 that survive through the great time of trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<!-------------------------->\r\n<div class="excerpt_end">\r\n<!-- THIS CLASS IS NEEDED --> \r\n<!-------------------------->\r\n\r\n    <p>The Herald now shows me a person standing not too far away. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cShe who slept in the ground is now awake and stands as a sign of the Great Promise Keeper who promised that, if faithful, she would be with the 144,000 and see the coming of the One of All Greatness.\xe2\x80\x9d I know who she is and I watch many angels attend her as she looks with all anticipation to the east at a small black cloud. I also know that at the same time there is a resurrection of those that condemned, beat, and crucified Jesus.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-1" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-1\')" >1</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-1" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Early Writings, p. 40</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        Then the angel said, "You must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000, shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God." \r\n        </span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n        <span class="fn-ref">The Great Controversy, pp. 636, 637</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        Graves are opened, and "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (Dan. 12:2). All who have died in the faith of the third angel\'s message come forth from the tomb glorified to hear God\'s covenant of peace with those who have kept His law. "They also which pierced Him" (Rev. 1:7), those that mocked and derided Christ\'s dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory, and to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-1").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-1", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>The Herald now says to watch closely. As if time was sent into high speed, I watch the whole scene play quickly through to Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Second Coming. Then the time slows down to where all the angels are singing. As the Herald sings, he becomes brighter and brighter.</p>\r\n    <p>I now see Jesus raise a trumpet to His lips. The sound that comes forth is unlike any trumpet that human ears can imagine. I then hear His command, \xe2\x80\x9cAwake, awake, awake.\xe2\x80\x9d Next there is an earthquake, yet the righteous do not feel it and are not affected by it. The scene I watch now is the fulfillment of all that Jesus came to this earth for. This scene, along with everything else I have watched, is one of many events that are more wonderful than words can exclaim.</p>\r\n    <p>Suddenly the ground opens up and those that have been laid to rest in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name come up out of the ground. Their appearance changes to a look of immortal glory that only the Great Creator can accomplish. Only those lips could have called these sleeping ones from beneath the earth. I am made to understand that many come up from far under the ground and that it is happening worldwide. Each hear Christ\xe2\x80\x99s voice and come up from the depths of the oceans, the seas, and from deep under mountains. These are His beloved ones from the time of the first death to the massive changes of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface during the Flood and through millennia of sin\xe2\x80\x99s hold on this planet. There are so many that I am reminded of the sand on the beach. However, the Great Crucified One who died the death of deaths and was raised on that third day now, in the glory of all glory, watches as His people rise to meet Him. In the middle of blinking my eyes, I see these who are they as their appearance changes to perfection. The Herald now tells me it is time again to leave because there is more to see and that before this scene can play out there is still much to be done.</p>\r\n    <p>Next I find myself standing in a parking lot. I see a large group of people. There is a lot of discussion between them. At times it is almost as if some are trying to force their opinions on others to have them believe as they do. I notice two older cars parked next to us. They are about a 1950\xe2\x80\x99s vintage and I marvel at their heaviness and large size. They are very roomy inside and the doors open outwards from the middle. As the large group of people divides into two groups, one group has a majority and the other has just four people. Everyone decides to get into either of the two cars. I notice that each car is an insignificant gray in color and has the same license plate which says, \xe2\x80\x9cS.D.A.C.\xe2\x80\x9d I am puzzled how two cars could have the same license plate and wonder what S.D.A.C. stands for. Then I realize that both cars represent the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that is what the initials stand for.</p>\r\n    <p>I now see so many people get into one car that it is filled up to the roof and many have their faces pressed against the windows. As individuals continue to climb in, I hear them say that this is the correct car and that with so many, it is obvious that it is the only car to be in. I then see that there are only four others left plus myself who get into the other car. The driver is a man with long hair and a beard. I am sitting in the right front seat and three other individuals sit in the back. The two cars drive off on a one lane road and the other car starts leading the way. Some of the passengers lean out a window and shout to us that their car is the one to be in and that we should follow only them.</p>\r\n    <p>As we continue on, the road changes to two lanes.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-2" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-2\')" >2</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-2" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Signs of the Times, June 22, 1904</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        The two roads mentioned lead in opposite directions; one is narrow and rugged, the other is wider and smoother, but it ends in destruction. Those who travel these two roads are opposite in character, dress, and conversation. Those in the narrow way are serious and earnest, yet cheerful. The Man of sorrows opened the way for them, and traveled it Himself. They see His footsteps, and are comforted. As they travel on, they talk of the joy and happiness that await them in their journey\'s end.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-2").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-2", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> The driver of the car I am in maneuvers to where we are in the right lane next to them. The people in the other car continue to tell us that theirs is the only car to be in, that we need to follow because there are so many of them and that shows they are doing what is right.</p>\r\n    <p>As we proceed along, we notice a road sign ahead showing that the two lanes will divide, one going left and the other right. The driver of the other car starts shouting that we need to follow them since there are so many, that they are all correct and we need to go to the left. He begins to yell louder and shouts insults about our incompetence and that we do not understand correctly and should follow their example, since they are very knowledgeable from doing extensive studies about the course that needs to be taken. The driver of the car I am in remains calm and states that we will go right, that the road will have many problems but the car will make it along the perilous journey.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-3" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-3\')" >3</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-3" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Manuscript Releases, Vol. 3, No. 427</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        Christ never murmured, never uttered discontent, displeasure, or resentment. He was never disheartened, discouraged, ruffled, or fretted. He was patient, calm, and self-possessed under the most exciting and trying circumstances. All His works were performed with a quiet dignity and ease, whatever commotion was around Him. Applause did not elate Him. He feared not the threats of His enemies. He moved amid the world of excitement, of violence and crime, as the sun moves above the clouds. Human passions and commotions and trials were beneath Him. He sailed like the sun above them all. Yet He was not indifferent to the woes of men. His heart was ever touched with the sufferings and necessities of His brethren, as though He Himself was the one afflicted. He had a calm inward joy, a peace which was serene. His will was ever swallowed up in the will of His Father. Not My will but Thine be done, was heard from His pale and quivering lips.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-3").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-3", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> He says that the car will handle all the pitfalls and obstacles that it approaches. He explains that from the debris in the road, it may look like the car will have mechanical problems and break down, but it will keep running.</p>\r\n    <p>As we approach the \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99 in the road, the other car continues on to the left. I notice their road is well paved and smooth but has a slight downgrade. The car I am in continues on to the right. The road begins to ascend and the pavement changes to gravel then to dirt. We feel the car drop into many large potholes and the wheels roll along deep ruts. We hear the underside of the car drag and wonder if the muffler will fall off. As we slowly proceed on, we notice the road continues to ascend and to deteriorate. We are concerned that the car will get stuck in some of the large holes, but it keeps going. We then notice what looks like a landslide. It is difficult to maneuver over and around the debris.</p>\r\n    <p>As we continue on, we are amazed that the color of our car is changing. We knew when starting out that it was an insignificant gray, but as we approach more trouble in the road, the car begins to turn whiter and brighter. Even with all the dust and dirt, the car becomes cleaner. The road continues to narrow. Many boulders and large logs roll down the hill directly into our path. As the car hits them hard and shakes up and down, we fear there has been extreme front-end damage and that the wheels will fall off, but the car continues on.</p>\r\n    <p>We are now wondering how the other car is doing and whether we went the right way. Our driver states that the car is still in perfect condition but that the road will get worse. We wonder how it can get any worse. Continuing on we notice what looks like the aftermath of an earthquake. I look at our driver and he assures us that we will be safe and that this car will keep going.</p>\r\n    <p>We now notice that part of the road has dropped off into a deep crevasse. Our driver, whom we now have complete faith in, steers the car around the problem. As we travel on, many uprooted trees lie in the middle of the now very small road. Our driver maneuvers the car along the edge of a cliff to get around the trees.</p>\r\n    <p>As we round a corner, we notice a military blockade. They signal us to stop and a soldier walks over and orders me to step out of the car. Stepping out I notice I am now in mud. I try to clean it off, but it does not come off. The soldier hands me a rag to use, but as I do my shoes become dirtier and now have grease on them as well. I get back into the car and the soldier informs us that we have come the wrong way, that we should have taken the other road. He states that this road is not the right road and that we should turn around.</p>\r\n    <p>Our driver now leans forward, looks at the soldier and tells him to raise the gate, because we are going to proceed on, since that is the way we must go. He says that the other car was filled with many but that few are in this car. He looks at the soldier and with authority states, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to raise the gate--now!\xe2\x80\x9d The soldier looks down then motions for the gateman to raise the gate. I look over at our driver and see his hair turn a bright white. He turns to me and it is then that I see in His eyes a love that cannot be described--the love of the love of the love!<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-4" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-4\')" >4</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-4" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Signs of the Times, June 22, 1904</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        The pathway to heaven is narrow, but no one need fail of finding it. It has been plainly marked out by the Father\'s hand. Not one trembling sinner need fail of walking in pure and holy light. Altho the upward path is sometimes difficult and often wearisome, altho the Christian may have to endure toil and conflict, yet let him go forward with rejoicing, trusting as a little child in the loving guidance of Him "who keepeth the feet of His saints," knowing that the path he is traveling will bring him at last to the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for those who love Him. "The path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day."</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-4").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-4", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>My dream now changes and I am standing in a hallway. The Herald says that he is to place me somewhere else and that I will understand what I am to be shown. I now find myself sitting in the top row of a stadium. I notice that the seats are very close together. We are all packed into this stadium, which holds about 250,000 people. Far down in front of me is a platform but there is no podium so that the speaker can turn and address everyone.</p>\r\n    <p>An individual now walks onto the platform and quotes Joel 2:28 and Acts 2:17. He states that we are told in the last days that old men will have dreams. He pauses and then asks if there is anyone here that has had dreams. I scan the stadium to see all the hands go up, but there is not a single one. I decide that I must be the only one and raise my hand. The speaker points to me and says, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is someone who says they are having dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d He asks me to stand and share what I have seen in my dreams. I am amazed that even without a microphone my voice carries through the entire stadium. I tell him I will share but that first I must ask a question. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cContinue.\xe2\x80\x9d I ask of all assembled that if they are not a Seventh-day Adventist to please raise their hand. No hands go up so I ask for all to indulge me and to stand up. While they are standing, I state that if anyone is a Seventh-day Adventist to please sit down. No one is left standing. I explain that this exercise is to show that all those in the stadium are Seventh-day Adventists.</p>\r\n    <p>Next I proceed to share a summation of the many dreams I have had. I mention about the dream of heaven and all the wondrous things I saw. Many amens can be heard. I share about how an angel on a white horse came and instructed me about the importance of the cross and the fact that we are to observe Saturday as the Sabbath and not Sunday. I share about the book <em>Creeping Compromise</em>, the dreams of the SDA Church and the ABC\xe2\x80\x99s. I hear many amens and encouraging comments. People state that this is of God and that they need to listen to these messages. Then I mention the dream of how many people will be martyred and all gets very quiet. I mention how important it is that we return our tithe. I hear many loud amens from the men in black suits. I share that although it is important that we return a tithe it is equally important that we know what the tithe is being used for and that God will hold us accountable. I explain that this is the same as what Ellen White states.</p>\r\n    <p>I now hear several of these men in black suits state very loudly that these dreams are not of God but of Satan, that the only place to pay your tithe is directly to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Someone in front of me states that I am a fake and that I should not be listened to. He says that everyone should leave immediately and that what they have heard is all of Satan. I am in shock as I see this large assembly of people quickly leave because of the negative comments of the men in black suits. They no longer want to hear or believe. Almost everyone is now gone.</p>\r\n    <p>I begin walking down the steps to leave. After I get to the bottom and I turn to leave I notice about twenty people standing and talking. One of them states that some of them are going to study what I have shared to prove it is not of God. I see thirteen people turn and walk following the individual and they are going to form a study group. I look at the remaining seven. A woman with three of her friends states that they have been following what a certain individual has been teaching. They hold up many books, DVDs and CDs by this person and she mentions how this individual has so much to teach. I notice no Bible or Spirit of Prophecy books. The four people turn and walk away. I now look at the last three people. One of them walks away from the other two and kneels to pray. I look at the last two people. One immediately starts saying that the Holy Spirit is not a person. The other one states that we must believe as the original pioneers. One states that I will be lost unless I admit that the Holy Spirit is not a real person and not a part of the Godhead. I see these two walk away. I turn to the one lady who is now getting up from her knees. She comes to me and asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I need to do to get ready? How do I begin to repent? What do I need to know to be ready when Jesus comes?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>My dream changes again and I instantly find myself outdoors and observing from above at an angle. I see several men remove their black robes and place them in a large washing machine. They add several gallons of laundry detergent and several gallons of bleach. After what seems a few minutes they remove the robes and discuss that they are not white enough. They decide to wash them again, adding several packages of white dye. After a few minutes they remove them and discuss that they still are not white enough. They decide to spray them all white with a cloth spray paint. Then they apply a large golden seven to the front of each robe and put them on as well as blue and silver sashes around their neck.</p>\r\n    <p>Next the men walk over and face a giant peach, then turn toward many people who bow and kneel in front of them. Many repeatedly chant, \xe2\x80\x9cTeach us, oh enlightened ones, for we listen and you will tell us what we are to do.\xe2\x80\x9d I now rise further into the air and see the men again face the giant peach. Turning to the right, I see a large rock come down and smash the giant peach. The rock disappears and I see what looks like many small pieces of burning coal fall from the air and burn up the area where the peach was. The peach as well as all the men and those that kneeled are gone.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald, who has been holding my hand the whole time, calls me by my heavenly name and says that what I just witnessed could happen, but we must understand that He who sits on the throne and knows all to no end knows what would be best, and He might not allow this to occur.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald now states that he is to take me somewhere, along with Becky. We are now in a large, light pink-colored room. There are thousands of people dressed in many layers of clothes, including thick coats, gloves, hats and boots over their shoes. Many have back packs on their backs. They have boxes, trunks, carts and suitcases with them.</p>\r\n    <p>Looking at the ceiling, I notice the face of a compass without a needle. It is painted on the center of the ceiling. The north, south, and west pointers are the same length from the center. However, the east pointer is three times as long and points to the only doors in the room. There are two doors that open outwards, which form a narrow opening with barely enough room for one person to fit through.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-5" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-5\')" >5</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-5" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Signs of the Times, June 22, 1904</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        But the way of life is narrow, and the entrance straight. If you cling to any besetting sin, you will find the gateway too narrow for you to enter. Your own ways, your own will, your wrong habits and unchristlike practises, must be given up if you would keep the way of the Lord. He who would follow Christ can not follow the world\'s opinions or meet the world\'s standard. Heaven\'s path is too narrow for rank and riches to ride in state, too narrow for the plan of self-centered ambition, too steep and rugged for lovers of ease to climb. Toil, patience, self-sacrifice, reproach, poverty, the contradiction of sinners against Himself, was the portion of Christ, and it must be our portion, if we ever enter the Paradise of God.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-5").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-5", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script></p>\r\n    <p>The doors can only be opened by a device above the doors. This device looks like a clock but does not have a face, just a single hand that moves very slowly. Above and to the left is a large see-through gold hopper. It has large, round, silver balls that shimmer. When the single hand points to the top position, the balls fall from the hopper one at a time down the track and into a container, giving power to the hand on the clock. When the single hand is almost at the top, a ball has almost reached the container and another takes its place. The single hand begins its trip around the clock again. The hopper now has very few balls left. When the last ball goes through the mechanism, the doors will open for a very short time and then close, never to be opened again. Those that do not go through remain in the room forever.</p>\r\n    <p>Becky and I begin telling the people that the balls are almost gone, that the doors will soon be open and they need to get ready to go through. We explain that they need to leave their boxes, suitcases, trunks, and layers of clothes or they will not fit through the doorway.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-6" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-6\')" >6</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-6" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Object Lessons, p. 318</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        In heaven it is said by the ministering angels: The ministry which we have been commissioned to perform we have done. We pressed back the army of evil angels. We sent brightness and light into the souls of men, quickening their memory of the love of God expressed in Jesus. We attracted their eyes to the cross of Christ. Their hearts were deeply moved by a sense of the sin that crucified the Son of God. They were convicted. They saw the steps to be taken in conversion; they felt the power of the gospel; their hearts were made tender as they saw the sweetness of the love of God. They beheld the beauty of the character of Christ. But with the many it was all in vain. They would not surrender their own habits and character. They would not put off the garments of earth in order to be clothed with the robe of heaven. Their hearts were given to covetousness. They loved the associations of the world more than they loved their God. \r\n         <br /><br />        Sad will be the retrospect in that day when men stand face to face with eternity. The whole life will present itself just as it has been. The world\'s pleasures, riches, and honors will not then seem so important. Men will then see that the righteousness they despised is alone of value. They will see that they have fashioned their characters under the deceptive allurements of Satan. The garments they have chosen are the badge of their allegiance to the first great apostate. Then they will see the results of their choice. They will have a knowledge of what it means to transgress the commandments of God.</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-6").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-6", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> However, we are ignored and many turn away from us and form into groups. Many make fun of us and laugh. Some of the groups have a man who becomes a leader. He climbs on top of some of the boxes to speak to the large groups of people, teaching them of a grand plan he has. He instructs that if they listen to him, he will show them how they can leave the room. Some of the men are saying that the people will be saved by listening to them, but they need to contribute some of their goods to them to help in preparing others to be saved. They state that the cost to leave is great but soon they will have their freedom if they trust in what they are taught.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the groups have the idea of each holding a box, suitcase, or trunk and running toward the doors as soon as they open. Even though we told them they would not fit through with their baggage, they do not listen or believe. Other groups are taught that it is the brotherly thing to carry another brother while that one carries a box, suitcase or trunk. We again attempt to show them that the opening is only large enough for a single person to fit through, that there is no room for anyone to bring their personal belongings. We again explain that the doors will be open for only a very short time and then will close. All of the many groups have someone teaching that they will be alright and will get through.</p>\r\n    <p>As Becky and I teach the people, we get rid of our personal belongings. Then we notice that a few others begin doing the same. However, there are others who rush to collect or sell the things we have discarded. We keep glancing at the clock mechanism and know there are but a few balls left. We again tell people to dispose of their belongings because the doors will be opening very soon. However, they laugh and make fun of us. Feeling sadness for them, we head for the doorway. A small group of us stand at the threshold and hum the song \xe2\x80\x9cJust as I Am.\xe2\x80\x9d I turn and notice the other groups are engrossed in what the other men have taught them.</p>\r\n    <p>The last ball now leaves the hopper. As it rolls along the track, the mechanism changes into a beautiful blue color. It drops into the holder and a voice without description is heard saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are faithful in the smallest of things, I grant unto you the greatest of things. Enter into all I have created for My faithful beloved.\xe2\x80\x9d The doors now open and one at a time we walk through. The other groups that were left behind notice the open doorway and run toward it but cannot get through because of their baggage. Some frantically try to dispose of their belongings, but the doors now begin to close. I hear their screams and cries. The doors are closing and will never open again.<sup id="footnote-tooltip-ref-7" class="footnote-tooltip-text" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-reference-ref-7\')" >7</sup><span class="footnote-tooltip" id="footnote-tooltip-text-ref-7" style=" display: none;"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Amos 8:11-13</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n         Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD: And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.

Upon His head were many crowns, a crown within a crown. Surrounded by the angelic host, He left heaven. The plagues were falling upon the inhabitants of the earth. Some were denouncing God and cursing Him. Others rushed to the people of God and begged to be taught how they might escape His judgments. But the saints had nothing for them. The last tear for sinners had been shed, the last agonizing prayer offered, the last burden borne, the last warning given. The sweet voice of mercy was no more to invite them. When the saints, and all heaven, were interested for their salvation, they had no interest for themselves. Life and death had been set before them. Many desired life, but made no effort to obtain it. They did not choose life, and now there was no atoning blood to cleanse the guilty, no compassionate Saviour to plead for them, and cry, "Spare, spare the sinner a little longer." All heaven had united with Jesus, as they heard the fearful words, "It is done. It is finished." The plan of salvation had been accomplished, but few had chosen to accept it. And as mercy\'s sweet voice died away, fear and horror seized the wicked. With terrible distinctness they heard the words, "Too late! too late!"<br />\r\n         <br />\r\n         Those who had not prized God\'s Word were hurrying to and fro, wandering from sea to sea, and from the north to the east, to seek the Word of the Lord. Said the angel, "They shall not find it. There is a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord. What would they not give for one word of approval from God! but no, they must hunger and thirst on. Day after day have they slighted salvation, prizing earthly riches and earthly pleasure higher than any heavenly treasure or inducement. They have rejected Jesus and despised His saints. The filthy must remain filthy forever."</span></span></span><script type="text/javascript">  jQuery("#footnote-tooltip-ref-7").tooltip({ tip: "#footnote-tooltip-text-ref-7", tipClass: "footnote-tooltip", effect: "fade", fadeOutSpeed: 100, predelay: 400, position: "bottom center", relative: true, offset: [0, 10]}).dynamic({bottom: {direction: "down", bounce: true}}); </script> Now we notice that each in our small group is glowing with a bright light around them.</p>\r\n    <p>I have been holding Becky with my left hand and now someone takes my right hand. I turn to see the Herald. He smiles at me and says to hold tightly to Becky\xe2\x80\x99s hand. We all turn, walk through a wall and now stand in a corridor. Calling me by my heavenly name, the Herald looks at Becky and me and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have just seen and experienced has a deeper meaning. Reach whom you can, but above all get ready yourselves for the time to exit is short, before those that will be sealed are sealed. Those that want to leave, want nothing from where they came.

He says he needs to take me somewhere else so that I can get a better understanding. I am to notice what I will see and report it. We go to where I stand in front of a small desk. I notice a daily desk calendar that I understand to be a gift. There is a cartoon at the top and a humorous caption underneath. I look at the picture, read the caption and laugh. I flip to the next page, look at the picture, read the caption and flip the page again to the next day. I continue flipping through the pages, day after day. Suddenly, the calendar pages begin slowly flipping by themselves. I watch in amazement as the pages begin flipping faster and faster. The pages now flip so fast that it is just a blur.</p>\r\n    <p>I now walk to a window and notice the grass in the yard is growing very fast. In the blink of an eye the grass is now mown, then begins growing again. I look up and notice the sun is moving across the sky very fast from the east to the west. This is followed by the moon moving across the sky and it is constantly changing its size. I see it go from a full moon to a small sliver and then back to a full moon. This is followed by the sun moving across the sky followed by the moon again. I now notice tree limbs and leaves growing. Looking up to the sky, I see stars streaking across. It is like time is compressed, passing by rapidly.</p>\r\n    <p>Everything now comes to a quick halt. All sound stops. Everything is still and quiet. Suddenly there is an incredibly loud sound that does not have a description. It resembles the sounds of a million train or truck horns blowing at the same time. The black fabric of the still night sky now rips apart and there is a brightness that has no description.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald now states that we are again to go somewhere else. We begin walking along a paved walkway. As we walk along he refers to me by my heavenly name many times. He tells me to constantly be aware of where I am going and that each step must be carefully placed. He tells me that Satan and his angels will be constantly placing many obstacles in my path. They will be trying to trip me and cause me to fall. He tells me that if I keep my eyes looking up and focused on the main prize that I will be safe. I look up and now see how the clouds look just like Jesus. I see the clouds form a large smile from Jesus. I can make out the details of His hand reaching out to me. I do not want to move my eyes from what I see.</p>\r\n    <p>I notice that each step I take is softer on the hard pavement. The Herald tells me that there will be things that are hidden from my view that will cause me to trip and fall. I look down for just a brief moment and notice that my right foot falls through the now hard pavement. As I trip and fall, my hand is pulled from the Herald\xe2\x80\x99s hand. I roll down the bank on the right and plunge deep into a muddy river. There is a hard covering over the water and I must swim further out to climb up out of the water. I swim along close to the bottom of the river and now swim between two large concrete pillars. I barely squeeze through and as I do, my mind is instantly brought to the cloud and how it looked just like Jesus. I pray in my mind that Jesus would again extend His hand and help me. As I make my way through the small opening, I grab hold of the bottom of a ladder and feel a hand take hold of mine. It has a strength which I cannot describe. I feel myself pulled quickly from the depths of the water and gently placed on a dock. I turn to see Jesus standing there. He calls me by my heavenly name and we begin walking together. He says there is somewhere He wants to take me.</p>\r\n    <p>We walk up a paved pathway and toward a small village. We now reach a building that represents many things. It is an outreach place for people to learn of Jesus as well as a clothing store, a restaurant, and a theater where guests can eat and watch a movie. We walk up to the building and Jesus says that I am to go on from here but that He is always watching over me and always, always with me. All I need to do is call on Him and He is there to care for me.</p>\r\n    <p>As I turn to go in the building, I see a ticket machine and I cannot go in unless I get a ticket. As I pull on my ticket it slides out of the machine easily. It is made of pure gold, will not crease if I fold it and cannot be torn. It is about 12 inches long, 7 inches high and thinner than a human hair. On the front of it in dark red letters are the words \xe2\x80\x9cADMIT ONE.\xe2\x80\x9d To the left is a blue picture of the Ten Commandments. To the right in white is a picture of a cross and below it are the words, \xe2\x80\x9cStand on the wood, as the wood is truth.\xe2\x80\x9d In the middle is a picture that turns as you look at it. It is the most beautiful picture of Jesus coming in the clouds. This picture is made up of all different colors. I turn the ticket over and what is on the front can be seen through the back. It is not reversed and is clear on both sides.</p>\r\n    <p>As I pass through the turnstile, a woman welcomes me and says that I am first to get all new clothes and shoes, since mine are wet and filthy from the river. I am taken to a room where I pass through and am instantly clean and wearing all new clothes. I walk around and find many employees talking with people from the street. They talk in a level they can understand.</p>\r\n    <p>I now go to an area where there are steps that go up and seats with a built-in table for each person. Many come in and sit down. A woman employee comes through with bowls that are each about 12 inches across and 7 inches deep. She places a bowl on each of the tables. When she approaches me, she smiles but does not place a bowl at my table. She reaches down and puts her hand on mine. She does not say a word but I understand. She continues handing out the bowls.</p>\r\n    <p>Another woman now comes through with a ladle, and with her is a man who carries a very large pot. They place a large helping of stew in each bowl that is filled to the top. The stew consists of large chunks of grade-A prime beef with no fat and a small amount of carrots and peas. A third of the bowl is filled with beef broth. When the woman with the ladle gets to me, she pauses, looks at me, does not say a word but reaches down and places her hand on my hand. The man with the large pot pauses in front of me and places his right hand on my right shoulder. He does not say a word but smiles at me. Again I understand. Another woman now carries in a large bread basket and places a large loaf of bread on each table. Each loaf is round and about 12 inches across and 7 inches high. When the woman gets to me, she does not put any bread on my table but smiles at me and puts her hand on my hand. Again I understand.</p>\r\n    <p>After everyone receives their meal, a woman walks out in front and below from where we sit. She says, "Let\xe2\x80\x99s pray. Thank you, Lord, for this meal and for a place to come in from the evil of the world. This broth is like the Holy Spirit. This bread that represents Jesus can be brought into our bodies. This meat is His Word.\xe2\x80\x9d She ends her prayer and says that we will all enjoy a very special movie while we dine. Behind her is what looks like a wall coming down to serve as a screen. The windows, the ticket machines and the front of the building are behind it. I begin watching the most tremendous movie I have ever seen, although I do not remember it after the dream.</p>\r\n    <p>When the movie ends, a woman comes to the middle of the room. She quietly explains that something horrible happened while we dined and watched the movie. The wall goes up and we see that the huge plate-glass window is shattered and someone has stolen one of the ticket machines. She explains that the machine had just been refilled with a new roll of tickets, that each roll held a large amount of tickets and each ticket was invaluable. I then hear a man behind me who stands up and says that he is an elder. He mumbles his name and explains that an offering of almost $13 has been collected to help purchase a new ticket machine. Compelled to stand and speak, I tell them that although all small gifts are appreciated, there is only one gift and that is Jesus. I tell them this tragedy would never have happened if we had only asked God to protect this place, that when we ask for His protection He will take care of that which is His.</p>\r\n    <p>I now notice a man who looks like an evil criminal. He stands not too far up the street in front of the building, and the stolen ticket machine is next to him. He begins to run to hit the other plate-glass window in order to steal the other ticket machine. I cry out for God to protect us and send His angels to surround not only us but the building and that He will reclaim the stolen machine. As I prepare to say amen the whole group in one voice says amen in the name of Jesus. Immediately the man runs and hits the front of the building with his shoulder and it is as if an invisible shield has been placed around the building, because the man bounces back. He gets up and again tries with all his strength to break the window but again he bounces back. The building is safe.</p>\r\n    <p>We now turn and notice many angels descending around the stolen ticket machine. One angel who excels in strength easily picks up the machine while many other angels lead a procession back to the building. The strong angel places the machine back where it belongs and we watch as all the angels ascend.</p>\r\n    <p>Next the Herald says he is to take me somewhere special. Instantly I am with Jesus. He is holding my right hand as we walk through a corridor that is not straight. We turn right for a ways, then left, right and left again. The corridor does not have regular square walls or a ceiling. Instead they appear as mirrors of different sizes and shapes and are placed at different angles. We continue on in silence, turn and begin walking straight, then descend down a walkway. We enter into what I think is a very, very large room but yet at the same time I know it is not a room. It is as if I am seeing our galaxy where our planet would be. I see what appear to be many, many more mirrors. There are even small dime-sized mirrors placed in different areas. All the mirrors do not have a flat surface but are rounded in one way or another and are not sharp or hard. I am made to know that the mirrors are not really mirrors. The floor is very soft to walk on.</p>\r\n    <p>As we come into the large area, it is filled with things that I do not have human words with which to describe. I feel awed as I look around. We stop and I am placed so that the walkway and corridor we just came from is behind me. Suddenly the room begins to glow with a brightness that illuminates the area. It is a beauty that again I cannot explain. I am made to understand that because of my sinful state, His brightness must be kept very low. If there was a knob that could be turned to allow the brightness, in which 0 is off and 10 is on high, the knob would be at a setting of 0.00000005.</p>\r\n    <p>I now hear a voice that I have heard before in my dreams. It is the sound resembling a small trickle of water as well as a mountain stream and a large waterfall. The voice says, \xe2\x80\x9cBehold, I make all things new.\xe2\x80\x9d Prior to this Jesus had not spoken a word. As I hear the voice coming from behind me, I see Jesus talk at the same time and say the exact words that I hear from behind me. I then notice words in the air above me that are being written as I stand there. I am in awe as I read the words. At the end it says, \xe2\x80\x9cRevelation 21:3-7.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>Many have experienced the love of a mother or father, a brother or sister, the love of a husband or wife. However, no kiss or embrace could ever compare to the love I sense from the voices that I am hearing. There are absolutely no words that can express it.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Revelation 21:3-7</em>.</blockquote>\r\n    <p>I turn to Jesus and begin crying. He wipes the tears from my face and asks why I am crying. I tell Him that I am sad because I know this is the last dream I will have. Jesus asks why I would think that. I explain that it was noticed some time ago how the dreams all seem to line up with each other on the website. The dream on the left always corresponds with the dream on the right either by title or content and this dream is the last one to line up with the dream on the left. Jesus responds, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you are in a dream. Where am I and what am I doing now?\xe2\x80\x9d I reply that I know He is in the Most Holy Place and that He serves as our Adjudicator. He smiles because this is the title the Herald told me in one of my earlier dreams. Jesus says, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is correct. Am I finished serving on your behalf and have I thrown down the censer? No. I am still serving on your behalf to our Father. I am not finished and you are not finished as I have messages for My people. Those that will hear My voice will hear. Those that do not hear My voice will not hear when at last I proclaim, \xe2\x80\x98Awake, awake, awake.\xe2\x80\x99 I have something very special I want you to enjoy but take notice to everything you see and experience.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>I am now instantly standing outside my home. I am amazed as I look up at the night sky. There are no clouds or moon and the temperature is perfectly comfortable. I begin talking silently to my heavenly Father as if He is standing next to me. I tell Him how wonderful the sky and the stars are and how each one has such a beauty, how they seem to twinkle on and off so slightly and that there are no words to describe them. I thank Him for such a perfect evening. As I listen to the distinct sounds of the crickets and frogs, the bats overhead and the calls of the coyotes in the distance, I thank Him for the variety of sounds. I express how much I appreciate the different gifts He has given us. Shooting stars now streak across the sky and I think how only He could create such a display and how I appreciate that each one is so special.</p>\r\n    <p>As I continue watching, I suddenly notice two shooting stars in perfect alignment, as if both are flying together. Instead of burning up in the atmosphere, they become brighter. Changing their direction, they now come straight down toward me. As they get closer, they slow down and become brighter. The night sky shines like the sun at noon and I see the trees and yard perfectly. As the two stars near me, they slow down and become less bright. I am in awe as I watch them stop immediately overhead and change into two angels. As they touch down in front of me, I recognize the angel to the right as the Herald, but I do not recognize the other angel. The Herald smiles at me, calls me by my heavenly name and says that they have been sent. He says that there is not a message to be given, but rather I am to be shown things, because many times the message is not in words, but in seeing. I am made to understand that the grandeur I am shown in dreams is not even close to what is reality. However, it is shown in a way that I can comprehend. If we are faithful, when this life is over, as it soon will be, we will witness the great grandeur from the very hand of the Grand Creator. What we have waiting for us is far from what we have the ability to comprehend. Pointing to the other angel, the Herald says that he will be taking me somewhere to enjoy just a little of what we have waiting for us. What I will witness is far from what really exists.</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald turns to the other angel and says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have already been instructed where to take him and what he is to see. He is to hear, speak, touch, smell and see, but not to taste or eat. That precious gift is reserved for the Giver of All Life.\xe2\x80\x9d The Herald now tells me, \xe2\x80\x9cNotice as much as possible. Converse with those you see. Exercise your curiosity. Touch, see, smell and listen. What you receive now is a gift of love from the Father of all and His Son and He that is the Holy Spirit. I will leave you for now. Enjoy!\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>The Herald now looks up and streaks across the sky faster than the blink of an eye. I turn to the other angel and ask his name. He answers, \xe2\x80\x9cI am also a messenger and today I have the extreme pleasure of being your guide.\xe2\x80\x9d I smile and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d He smiles at me and I already know what he is going to say. He responds, \xe2\x80\x9cWho we are is not important. The only name worthy of mention is Jesus Christ. He is your Brother and Savior, our Creator and the Son of the Father of all. I am to show you just a little of His love. May I have your right hand?\xe2\x80\x9d I give him my right hand and as our feet gently leave the ground, I look down and all is black except lights from the houses and vehicles below. I am thinking of what love Christ has in His care for this world. As we ascend, we speed up and soon I look down to see the blue atmosphere of our small planet. I know that blue is the color of His law, which is also His love without which we would die. I realize the white clouds symbolize His righteousness, and that we are always surrounded by His love and His righteousness. Without the clouds that provide shade and rain, we would not survive.</p>\r\n    <p>As we continue to ascend, I am now looking straight ahead and my guide says that we are now going to go very fast. He says to hold to my faith and know that I am safe. I ask where we are going. He answers, \xe2\x80\x9cTo where I was instructed to take you. We will be a long way from where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d We accelerate and the speed we travel is the same from \xe2\x80\x9cThe New Earth\xe2\x80\x9d dream. We travel billions and billions and billions of light years in what I know to be mere micro thought seconds. I ask if we are going to the end of the universe. My guide smiles and says that there is no end, that it is continual just as God is. It has no end, but yet each galaxy, each planet is always closest to His throne. This is difficult for us to understand, but if we are faithful, it will all be made plain. I am told to notice that as we travel all is bright and does not resemble the dark sky we see from Earth. There are many colors beyond description. I wish that I had command of all the words in a dictionary to express what I see.</p>\r\n    <p>As we continue traveling, my guide points to a galaxy just ahead of us that is unlike the Milky Way galaxy. He explains, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is our destination where you will explore and learn much.\xe2\x80\x9d As we approach, we slow down and he points out one of several planets that we will visit for a while. He says to notice that the planets are all close in proximity, perfectly complement each other, and their movement is fluid and complete in symmetry. I notice other beings moving as we are from planet to planet.</p>\r\n    <p>As we near our destination, I notice my guide grows larger in size until I am dwarfed in comparison. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember you are safe and that you will see why I had to be this size. If you are faithful, you too will grow to the stature of God\xe2\x80\x99s other creations.\xe2\x80\x9d As we descend I notice many people standing below. They knew we were coming and are singing to the glory of the Creator of all. As we touch down, I notice I am very small compared to the beings on this planet. They are not male or female and each has a glow about them which speaks of the Father\xe2\x80\x99s love. My guide introduces me with my heavenly name and says that I am one of God\xe2\x80\x99s messengers. He affirms that if I am faithful to continue my battle against Satan, to encourage others and point them to Jesus, that I will visit here one day and not just in a dream. I look at my guide and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a dream?\xe2\x80\x9d I hear many laughing. One steps forward and asks my guide, \xe2\x80\x9cMay some of us show him around?\xe2\x80\x9d The angel replies that I am to see, hear, smell, and touch, but not to taste or eat, and that he was instructed to allow them to place me in their care.</p>\r\n    <p>The one being comes to me and asks, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I have your right hand?\xe2\x80\x9d I give him my right hand and ask him his name. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cEven though we all have names and we have been told your heavenly name, you are unable to say it because you are still from the sinful earth. We were told if you are faithful, you will be able to speak and understand all. Remember this is a dream and you will experience what you are able to comprehend.\xe2\x80\x9d As I look up, I notice these beings have very tanned skin and shoulder-length hair that is wavy and golden. They appear very strong, symmetrical, and perfect as the Great Creator created them. I ask why they are so tall and perfect, and if they always looked this way. The one smiles and speaks very gently, saying that they have always looked that way because they never partook of their tree of knowledge of good and evil, but that Satan was able to deceive Eve into eating the fruit of a similar tree placed on the earth. He explains that is the only place in the universe where Satan introduced sin. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have watched day after day what he has done, and we sing praises to the name of Jesus that He now stands on your behalf. Before Adam and Eve sinned, Jesus walked with them each Sabbath through the gardens on Earth. He walked with us at the same time as He did with all of His creations throughout the universe. When it was decided that Jesus would become one of you, we knew that He would no longer be able to spend time with us. What He did was done to save you, our brothers. This too is something you will learn. Now we want to show you things and let you enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>We had been walking slowly and now the one being picks me up, holds me in his arms and says we need to move a little faster. He walks very fast and we arrive in an open field. He stops and says to notice the grass. It is about seven feet tall, yet he stands in it very easily. He says to notice the sky and I see that the other planets appear as if they can be touched just by reaching out to them. I now notice indescribable birds and animals of all types that fly, walk, run, or play. I see what appears to be a hummingbird with six wings and four tails. There are even small creatures that resemble insects, yet they are not pests and do not look like what we have on Earth. The grassy field is teeming with life--more than I can see or comprehend. The grass is many hues of green and is almost alive with love. I hear birds singing and know that no bird on our sinful planet can possibly achieve these perfect warbles of the avian musical registry.</p>\r\n    <p>Still holding me in his arms, my new friend says to look to the right. Several more beings are running through the field with amazing speed that causes a wake in the grass. They are not racing, but playing and laughing. My friend and others who are with us begin running toward a forest. As we get closer, I notice many of the beings are jumping from tree to tree or climbing them. These trees are the height of taller buildings on the earth. The bark of these beautiful trees is smooth, yet the patterns are symmetrical. From different angles the leaves have a green, yellow, red, blue and purple hue. Some of the leaves are large enough to cover the roof of a three-bedroom house. Even these trees have an abundance of life forms. There is every living creature one can imagine, from the smallest to the largest. Many creatures fly as if they are a burnt ember floating in the sky, but have full power of the direction in which to go. Flowers grow almost everywhere and come in a large variety of colors. A single touch of a flower causes its petals to open even more. I seem to hear a constant singing in which the words give praise to the Creator of all. I think how the 144,000 will travel the universe with Jesus to see His people.</p>\r\n    <p>I ask these beings if they are only able to walk and run or do they have the ability to fly. The group I am with laughs, and the one who holds me says to watch. We all lift off the ground and there is now a procession of many beings as we fly and see things from a different perspective. I see many small hills and some taller than others. In some places there are majestic waterfalls. The sky is beautiful hues of blue, filled with a vast assortment of birds. I am thinking how I would love to have a video recorder right now. I ask if we can get close to the water and if there are fish. My friend says we will get closer so I can see. As we near the water, there are many fish of different sizes, shapes, and colors. Some swim as fast as we are flying. Some move as if they are a gentle butterfly. Several of the friends that follow us go under the water. They do not come up for air and swim as fast as we flew in the air. Nearing the shoreline we begin to ascend and those under the water come up to fly with us. We now head to an area where there are valleys between hills. We land and my friend continues to carry me as we walk along trails next to streams. I notice again a variety of animals, birds and insects. The luscious growth and assortment of colors are so great that I cannot take it all in. I keep thinking that what I am seeing is nothing compared to what is really going to be.</p>\r\n    <p>I now notice that I do not see a sun yet the planets nearby reflect light that illuminates where we are. As we continue on I know that we are nearing another rich forest. His creations are singing like nothing I have heard before. All I can think is that united they sing \xe2\x80\x9choly, holy, holy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cglory to God and His Son in all that they have given.\xe2\x80\x9d As we continue, my friend sets me down and I walk along the path with them. I lean over to cup a flower in my hand, but it is the size of my upper body. Touching it I feel its softness and fragrance unlike any I have experienced. There is a mixture of the sweetest fragrances; even the trees perfume the forest where we walk. I touch the bark of a tree and expect it to feel rough, but it is very soft.</p>\r\n    <p>As night comes on, the light begins to dim, but it never gets as dark as on the earth. Each of my new friends now has a glow of light that emits from them and their golden hair is illuminated. When they smile, it is as if each has a brighter light which comes from inside. I notice that all of God\xe2\x80\x99s creations seem to illuminate in some way with an array of bioluminescent colors. The trees, grass, flowers, animals, fish and even the small insects that crawl on a blade of grass are alive with brilliant colors. I notice one insect that looks like a wooly worm. His long brown body is made of many tiny hairs that each light up in different shades of brown as it walks along. On its head are two very long antennae that curl at the end. Each has many small lights that go on and off as it goes up the length of the antennae. I see a variety of animals and birds that light up in many colors. The light is not bright but has a warm glow. I realize that each time I place my foot down in the grass that the area lights up a little brighter then slowly returns to less light. I now notice one small bird flies close to me and that its eyes are illuminated with different shades of blue. Its beak illuminates with red and orange colors. The feathers are iridescent colors of green, brown, blue, red, orange, and yellow. It sings in many notes simultaneously and in harmony, which makes one think of the Creator\xe2\x80\x99s love.</p>\r\n    <p>As I take in all that I have experienced, I remember again that what I was shown is far better than what I can comprehend. I close my eyes to get a mental record so I will remember it all. I open my eyes to look one more time, but when I do I am standing at my house looking up at the stars in the night sky. The Herald is holding my right hand. I begin to cry because I realize where I am. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember to stay faithful. This and so much more is waiting for you. Know that all in the universe anxiously wait to see a stop to the sin that Lucifer has brought in. All look forward to their walk with Jesus once again. Strive to be in that special group that will travel with Him as He walks with His people throughout the universe on Sabbath.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n    <p>After waking from this dream, I went to the window to look out. It was cold and foggy. I stared at the leafless trees and realized that I was still on this sin-sick world.</p>\r\n    <div class="footnote-reference-heading"><h3></h3></div><div class="footnote-reference-container"><table class="footnote-reference-table"><tbody><tr><td class="footnote-index"><span id="footnote-reference-ref-1">1.</span></td><td class="footnote-link"><span onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor(\'footnote-tooltip-ref-1\')"> &uarr; </span></td><td class="footnote-text"><span class="fn-container"><span class="fn-ref">Early Writings, p. 40</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        Then the angel said, "You must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000, shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God." \r\n        </span></span><span class="fn-container">\r\n        <span class="fn-ref">The Great Controversy, pp. 636, 637</span><span class="fn-body">\r\n        Graves are opened, and "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (Dan. 12:2).

They saw the steps to be taken in conversion; they felt the power of the gospel; their hearts were made tender as they saw the sweetness of the love of God. They beheld the beauty of the character of Christ. But with the many it was all in vain. They would not surrender their own habits and character.

Upon His head were many crowns, a crown within a crown. Surrounded by the angelic host, He left heaven. The plagues were falling upon the inhabitants of the earth. Some were denouncing God and cursing Him. Others rushed to the people of God and begged to be taught how they might escape His judgments. But the saints had nothing for them. The last tear for sinners had been shed, the last agonizing prayer offered, the last burden borne, the last warning given. The sweet voice of mercy was no more to invite them. When the saints, and all heaven, were interested for their salvation, they had no interest for themselves. Life and death had been set before them. Many desired life, but made no effort to obtain it. They did not choose life, and now there was no atoning blood to cleanse the guilty, no compassionate Saviour to plead for them, and cry, "Spare, spare the sinner a little longer." All heaven had united with Jesus, as they heard the fearful words, "It is done. It is finished." The plan of salvation had been accomplished, but few had chosen to accept it. And as mercy\'s sweet voice died away, fear and horror seized the wicked. With terrible distinctness they heard the words, "Too late! too late!"<br />\r\n         <br />\r\n         Those who had not prized God\'s Word were hurrying to and fro, wandering from sea to sea, and from the north to the east, to seek the Word of the Lord. Said the angel, "They shall not find it. There is a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the Lord. What would they not give for one word of approval from God! but no, they must hunger and thirst on. Day after day have they slighted salvation, prizing earthly riches and earthly pleasure higher than any heavenly treasure or inducement. They have rejected Jesus and despised His saints.
